Crowdsourcing has gained immense popularity in machine learning applications for obtaining large amounts of labeled data. Crowdsourcing is cheap and fast, but suffers from the problem of low-quality data. To address this fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing, we propose a simple payment mechanism to incentivize workers to answer only the questions that they are sure of and skip the rest. We show that surprisingly, under a mild and natural “no-free-lunch” requirement, this mechanism is the one and only incentive-compatible payment mechanism possible. We also show that among all possible incentive-compatible mechanisms (that may or may not satisfy no-free-lunch), our mechanism makes the smallest possible payment to spammers. Interestingly, this unique mechanism takes a “multiplicative” form. The simplicity of the mechanism is an added benefit. In preliminary experiments involving over several hundred workers, we observe a significant reduction in the error rates under our unique mechanism for the same or lower monetary expenditure.  
Convex potential minimisation is the de facto approach to binary classification. However, Long and Servedio [2010] proved that under symmetric label noise (SLN), minimisation of any convex potential over a linear function class can result in classification performance equivalent to random guessing. This ostensibly shows that convex losses are not SLN-robust. In this paper, we propose a convex, classification-calibrated loss and prove that it is SLN-robust. The loss avoids the Long and Servedio [2010] result by virtue of being negatively unbounded. The loss is a modification of the hinge loss, where one does not clamp at zero; hence, we call it the unhinged loss. We show that the optimal unhinged solution is equivalent to that of a strongly regularised SVM, and is the limiting solution for any convex potential; this implies that strong `2 regularisation makes most standard learners SLN-robust. Experiments confirm the unhinged loss’ SLN-robustness is borne out in practice. So, with apologies to Wilde [1895], while the truth is rarely pure, it can be simple.   
One of the central questions in statistical learning theory is to determine the conditions under which agents can learn from experience. This includes the necessary and sufficient conditions for generalization from a given finite training set to new observations. In this paper, we prove that algorithmic stability in the inference process is equivalent to uniform generalization across all parametric loss functions. We provide various interpretations of this result. For instance, a relationship is proved between stability and data processing, which reveals that algorithmic stability can be improved by post-processing the inferred hypothesis or by augmenting training examples with artificial noise prior to learning. In addition, we establish a relationship between algorithmic stability and the size of the observation space, which provides a formal justification for dimensionality reduction methods. Finally, we connect algorithmic stability to the size of the hypothesis space, which recovers the classical PAC result that the size (complexity) of the hypothesis space should be controlled in order to improve algorithmic stability and improve generalization.  
We develop a sequential low-complexity inference procedure for Dirichlet process mixtures of Gaussians for online clustering and parameter estimation when the number of clusters are unknown a-priori. We present an easily computable, closed form parametric expression for the conditional likelihood, in which hyperparameters are recursively updated as a function of the streaming data assuming conjugate priors. Motivated by large-sample asymptotics, we propose a novel adaptive low-complexity design for the Dirichlet process concentration parameter and show that the number of classes grow at most at a logarithmic rate. We further prove that in the large-sample limit, the conditional likelihood and data predictive distribution become asymptotically Gaussian. We demonstrate through experiments on synthetic and real data sets that our approach is superior to other online state-of-the-art methods.  
Monte Carlo sampling for Bayesian posterior inference is a common approach used in machine learning. The Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures that are used are often discrete-time analogues of associated stochastic differential equations (SDEs). These SDEs are guaranteed to leave invariant the required posterior distribution. An area of current research addresses the computational benefits of stochastic gradient methods in this setting. Existing techniques rely on estimating the variance or covariance of the subsampling error, and typically assume constant variance. In this article, we propose a covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin thermostat that can effectively dissipate parameter-dependent noise while maintaining a desired target distribution. The proposed method achieves a substantial speedup over popular alternative schemes for large-scale machine learning applications.  
We propose a robust portfolio optimization approach based on quantile statistics. The proposed method is robust to extreme events in asset returns, and accommodates large portfolios under limited historical data. Specifically, we show that the risk of the estimated portfolio converges to the oracle optimal risk with parametric rate under weakly dependent asset returns. The theory does not rely on higher order moment assumptions, thus allowing for heavy-tailed asset returns. Moreover, the rate of convergence quantifies that the size of the portfolio under management is allowed to scale exponentially with the sample size of the historical data. The empirical effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under both synthetic and real stock data. Our work extends existing ones by achieving robustness in high dimensions, and by allowing serial dependence.  
We study the problem of multiclass classification with an extremely large number of classes (k), with the goal of obtaining train and test time complexity logarithmic in the number of classes. We develop top-down tree construction approaches for constructing logarithmic depth trees. On the theoretical front, we formulate a new objective function, which is optimized at each node of the tree and creates dynamic partitions of the data which are both pure (in terms of class labels) and balanced. We demonstrate that under favorable conditions, we can construct logarithmic depth trees that have leaves with low label entropy. However, the objective function at the nodes is challenging to optimize computationally. We address the empirical problem with a new online decision tree construction procedure. Experiments demonstrate that this online algorithm quickly achieves improvement in test error compared to more common logarithmic training time approaches, which makes it a plausible method in computationally constrained large-k applications.  
We study the problem of hierarchical clustering on planar graphs. We formulate this in terms of finding the closest ultrametric to a specified set of distances and solve it using an LP relaxation that leverages minimum cost perfect matching as a subroutine to efficiently explore the space of planar partitions. We apply our algorithm to the problem of hierarchical image segmentation.  
We propose an approach for retrieving a sequence of natural sentences for an image stream. Since general users often take a series of pictures on their special moments, it would better take into consideration of the whole image stream to produce natural language descriptions. While almost all previous studies have dealt with the relation between a single image and a single natural sentence, our work extends both input and output dimension to a sequence of images and a sequence of sentences. To this end, we design a multimodal architecture called coherence recurrent convolutional network (CRCN), which consists of convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model. Our approach directly learns from vast user-generated resource of blog posts as text-image parallel training data. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art candidate methods, using both quantitative measures (e.g. BLEU and top-K recall) and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Given a similarity graph between items, correlation clustering (CC) groups similar items together and dissimilar ones apart. One of the most popular CC algorithms is KwikCluster: an algorithm that serially clusters neighborhoods of vertices, and obtains a 3-approximation ratio. Unfortunately, in practice KwikCluster requires a large number of clustering rounds, a potential bottleneck for large graphs. We present C4 and ClusterWild!, two algorithms for parallel correlation clustering that run in a polylogarithmic number of rounds, and provably achieve nearly linear speedups. C4 uses concurrency control to enforce serializability of a parallel clustering process, and guarantees a 3-approximation ratio. ClusterWild! is a coordination free algorithm that abandons consistency for the benefit of better scaling; this leads to a provably small loss in the 3 approximation ratio. We demonstrate experimentally that both algorithms outperform the state of the art, both in terms of clustering accuracy and running time. We show that our algorithms can cluster billion-edge graphs in under 5 seconds on 32 cores, while achieving a 15⇥ speedup.  
State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet [7] and Fast R-CNN [5] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. RPNs are trained end-to-end to generate highquality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. With a simple alternating optimization, RPN and Fast R-CNN can be trained to share convolutional features. For the very deep VGG-16 model [19], our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 (73.2% mAP) and 2012 (70.4% mAP) using 300 proposals per image. Code is available at https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn.ce-time is a profound concept in physics. This concept was shown to be useful for dimensionality reduction. We present basic definitions with interesting counter-intuitions. We give theoretical propositions to show that space-time is a more powerful representation than Euclidean space. We apply this concept to manifold learning for preserving local information. Empirical results on nonmetric datasets show that more information can be preserved in space-time.  
We propose a simple, scalable, and fast gradient descent algorithm to optimize a nonconvex objective for the rank minimization problem and a closely related family of semidefinite programs. With O(r3 κ2 n log n) random measurements of a positive semidefinite n×n matrix of rank r and condition number κ, our method is guaranteed to converge linearly to the global optimum.  
Interactive submodular set cover is an interactive variant of submodular set cover over a hypothesis class of submodular functions, where the goal is to satisfy all sufficiently plausible submodular functions to a target threshold using as few (cost-weighted) actions as possible. It models settings where there is uncertainty regarding which submodular function to optimize. In this paper, we propose a new extension, which we call smooth interactive submodular set cover, that allows the target threshold to vary depending on the plausibility of each hypothesis. We present the first algorithm for this more general setting with theoretical guarantees on optimality. We further show how to extend our approach to deal with realvalued functions, which yields new theoretical results for real-valued submodular set cover for both the interactive and non-interactive settings.  
Humans demonstrate remarkable abilities to predict physical events in dynamic scenes, and to infer the physical properties of objects from static images. We propose a generative model for solving these problems of physical scene understanding from real-world videos and images. At the core of our generative model is a 3D physics engine, operating on an object-based representation of physical properties, including mass, position, 3D shape, and friction. We can infer these latent properties using relatively brief runs of MCMC, which drive simulations in the physics engine to fit key features of visual observations. We further explore directly mapping visual inputs to physical properties, inverting a part of the generative process using deep learning. We name our model Galileo, and evaluate it on a video dataset with simple yet physically rich scenarios. Results show that Galileo is able to infer the physical properties of objects and predict the outcome of a variety of physical events, with an accuracy comparable to human subjects. Our study points towards an account of human vision with generative physical knowledge at its core, and various recognition models as helpers leading to efficient inference.  
This paper develops a general a learning an approximately revenue-maximizing auction from data. We introduce t-level auctions to interpolate between simple auctions, such as welfare maximization with reserve prices, and optimal auctions, thereby balancing the competing demands of expressivity and simplicity. We prove that such auctions have small representation error, in the sense that for every product distribution F over bidders’ valuations, there exists a t-level auction with small t and expected revenue close to optimal. We show that the set of t-level auctions has modest pseudodimension (for polynomial t) and therefore leads to small learning error. One consequence of our results is that, in arbitrary single-parameter settings, one can learn a mechanism with expected revenue arbitrarily close to optimal from a polynomial number of samples.  
Neural population activity often exhibits rich variability. This variability can arise from single-neuron stochasticity, neural dynamics on short time-scales, as well as from modulations of neural firing properties on long time-scales, often referred to as neural non-stationarity. To better understand the nature of co-variability in neural circuits and their impact on cortical information processing, we introduce a hierarchical dynamics model that is able to capture both slow inter-trial modulations in firing rates as well as neural population dynamics. We derive a Bayesian Laplace propagation algorithm for joint inference of parameters and population states. On neural population recordings from primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that our model provides a better account of the structure of neural firing than stationary dynamics models.  
We introduce the Locally Linear Latent Variable Model (LL-LVM), a probabilistic model for non-linear manifold discovery that describes a joint distribution over observations, their manifold coordinates and locally linear maps conditioned on a set of neighbourhood relationships. The model allows straightforward variational optimisation of the posterior distribution on coordinates and locally linear maps from the latent space to the observation space given the data. Thus, the LL-LVM encapsulates the local-geometry preserving intuitions that underlie non-probabilisticmethods such as locally linear embedding (LLE). Its probabilistic semantics make it easy to evaluate the quality of hypothesised neighbourhood relationships, select the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold, construct out-of-sample extensions and to combine the manifold model with additional probabilistic models that capture the structure of coordinates within the manifold.   
Color constancy is the recovery of true surface color from observed color, and requires estimating the chromaticity of scene illumination to correct for the bias it induces. In this paper, we show that the per-pixel color statistics of natural scenes—without any spatial or semantic context—can by themselves be a powerful cue for color constancy. Specifically, we describe an illuminant estimation method that is built around a “classifier” for identifying the true chromaticity of a pixel given its luminance (absolute brightness across color channels). Duringinference, each pixel’s observed color restricts its true chromaticity to those values that can be explained by one of a candidate set of illuminants, and applying the classifier over these values yields a distribution over the corresponding illuminants. A global estimate for the scene illuminant is computed through a simple aggregation of these distributions across all pixels. We begin by simply defining the luminance-to-chromaticity classifier by computing empirical histograms over discretized chromaticity and luminance values from a training set of natural images. These histograms reflect a preference for hues corresponding to smoothreflectance functions, and for achromatic colors in brighter pixels. Despite its simplicity, the resulting estimation algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art color constancy methods. Next, we propose a method to learn the luminanceto-chromaticity classifier “end-to-end”. Using stochastic gradient descent, we set chromaticity-luminance likelihoods to minimize errors in the final scene illuminant estimates on a training set. This leads to further improvements in accuracy, most significantly in the tail of the error distribution.  
We show that the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate of models derived from Luce’s choice axiom (e.g., the Plackett–Luce model) can be expressed as the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. This conveys insight into several recently proposed spectral inference algorithms. We take advantage of this perspective and formulate a new spectral algorithm that is significantly more accurate than previous ones for the Plackett–Luce model. With a simple adaptation, this algorithm can be used iteratively, producing a sequence of estimates that converges to the ML estimate. The ML version runs faster than competing approaches on a benchmark of five datasets. Our algorithms are easy to implement, making them relevant for practitioners at large.  
In deterministic optimization, line searches are a standard tool ensuring stability and efficiency. Where only stochastic gradients are available, no direct equivalent has so far been formulated, because uncertain gradients do not allow for a strict sequence of decisions collapsing the search space. We construct a probabilistic line search by combining the structure of existing deterministic methods with notions from Bayesian optimization. Our method retains a Gaussian process surrogate of the univariate optimization objective, and uses a probabilistic belief over the Wolfe conditions to monitor the descent. The algorithm has very low computational cost, and no user-controlled parameters. Experiments show that it effectively removes the need to define a learning rate for stochastic gradient descent.  
Despite the recent achievements in machine learning, we are still very far from achieving real artificial intelligence. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of standard deep learning approaches and show that some of these limitations can be overcome by learning how to grow the complexity of a model in a structured way. Specifically, we study the simplest sequence prediction problems that are beyond the scope of what is learnable with standard recurrent networks, algorithmically generated sequences which can only be learned by models which have the capacity to count and to memorize sequences. We show that some basic algorithms can be learned from sequential data using a recurrent network associated with a trainable memory.  
Humans have the remarkable ability to follow the gaze of other people to identify what they are looking at. Following eye gaze, or gaze-following, is an important ability that allows us to understand what other people are thinking, the actions they are performing, and even predict what they might do next. Despite the importance of this topic, this problem has only been studied in limited scenarios within the computer vision community. In this paper, we propose a deep neural networkbased approach for gaze-following and a new benchmark dataset, GazeFollow, for thorough evaluation. Given an image and the location of a head, our approach follows the gaze of the person and identifies the object being looked at. Our deep network is able to discover how to extract head pose and gaze orientation, and to select objects in the scene that are in the predicted line of sight and likely to be looked at (such as televisions, balls and food). The quantitative evaluation shows that our approach produces reliable results, even when viewing only the back of the head. While our method outperforms several baseline approaches, we are still far from reaching human performance on this task. Overall, we believe that gazefollowing is a challenging and important problem that deserves more attention from the community.  
Given a multi-armed bandit problem it may be desirable to achieve a smallerthan-usual worst-case regret for some special actions. I show that the price for such unbalanced worst-case regret guarantees is rather high. Specifically, if an algorithm enjoys a worst-case regret of B with respect to some action, then there must exist another action for which the worst-case regret is at least Ω(nK/B), where n is the horizon and K the number of actions. I also give upper bounds in both the stochastic and adversarial settings showing that this result cannot be improved. For the stochastic case the pareto regret frontier is characterised exactly up to constant factors.  
We consider the following detection problem: given a realization of a symmetric matrix X of dimension n, distinguish between the hypothesis that all upper triangular variables are i.i.d. Gaussians variables with mean 0 and variance 1 and the hypothesis that there is a planted principal submatrix B of dimension L for which all upper triangular variables are i.i.d. Gaussians with mean 1 and variance , whereas all other upper triangular elements of X not in B are i.i.d. Gaussians variables with mean 0 and variance 1.√ We refer to this as the ‘Gaussian hidden clique problem’. When L = (1 + ) n ( > 0), it is possible to solve this detection problem with probability 1 − on (1) by computing the spectrum of √ X and considering the largest eigenvalue of X. We prove that when L < (1 − ) n no algorithm that examines only the eigenvalues of X can detect the existence of a hidden Gaussian clique, with error probability vanishing as n → ∞. The result above is an immediate consequence of a more general result on rank-one perturbations of k-dimensional Gaussian tensors. In this context we establish a lower bound on the critical signal-to-noise ratio below which a rank-one signal cannot be detected.  
To improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo estimation, practitioners are turning to biased Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures that trade off asymptotic exactness for computational speed. The reasoning is sound: a reduction in variance due to more rapid sampling can outweigh the bias introduced. However, the inexactness creates new challenges for sampler and parameter selection, since standard measures of sample quality like effective sample size do not account for asymptotic bias. To address these challenges, we introduce a new computable quality measure based on Stein’s method that quantifies the maximum discrepancy between sample and target expectations over a large class of test functions. We use our tool to compare exact, biased, and deterministic sample sequences and illustrate applications to hyperparameter selection, convergence rate assessment, and quantifying bias-variance tradeoffs in posterior inference.  
Super resolving a low-resolution video is usually handled by either single-image super-resolution (SR) or multi-frame SR. Single-Image SR deals with each video frame independently, and ignores intrinsic temporal dependency of video frames which actually plays a very important role in video super-resolution. Multi-Frame SR generally extracts motion information, e.g., optical flow, to model the temporal dependency, which often shows high computational cost. Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can model long-term contextual information of temporal sequences well, we propose a bidirectional recurrent convolutional network for efficient multi-frame SR. Different from vanilla RNNs, 1) the commonly-used recurrent full connections are replaced with weight-sharing convolutional connections and 2) conditional convolutional connections from previous input layers to the current hidden layer are added for enhancing visual-temporal dependency modelling. With the powerful temporal dependency modelling, our model can super resolve videos with complex motions and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Due to the cheap convolution operations, our model has a low computational complexity and runs orders of magnitude faster than other multi-frame methods.  
Expectation Propagation is a very popular algorithm for variational inference, but comes with few theoretical guarantees. In this article, we prove that the approximation errors made by EP can be bounded. Our bounds have an asymptotic interpretation in the number n of datapoints, which allows us to study EP’s convergence with respect to the true posterior. In particular, we show that EP converges at a rate of O(n−2 ) for the mean, up to an order of magnitude faster than the traditional Gaussian approximation at the mode. We also give similar asymptotic expansions for moments of order 2 to 4, as well as excess Kullback-Leibler cost (defined as the additional KL cost incurred by using EP rather than the ideal Gaussian approximation). All these expansions highlight the superior convergence properties of EP. Our approach for deriving those results is likely applicable to many similar approximate inference methods. In addition, we introduce bounds on the moments of log-concave distributions that may be of independent interest.  
Nonlinear embedding algorithms such as stochastic neighbor embedding do dimensionality reduction by optimizing an objective function involving similarities between pairs of input patterns. The result is a low-dimensional projection of each input pattern. A common way to define an out-of-sample mapping is to optimize the objective directly over a parametric mapping of the inputs, such as a neural net. This can be done using the chain rule and a nonlinear optimizer, but is very slow, because the objective involves a quadratic number of terms each dependent on the entire mapping’s parameters. Using the method of auxiliary coordinates, we derive a training algorithm that works by alternating steps that train an auxiliary embedding with steps that train the mapping. This has two advantages: 1) The algorithm is universal in that a specific learning algorithm for any choice of embedding and mapping can be constructed by simply reusing existing algorithms for the embedding and for the mapping. A user can then try possible mappings and embeddings with less effort. 2) The algorithm is fast, and it can reuse N -body methods developed for nonlinear embeddings, yielding linear-time iterations.  
Here we introduce a new model of natural textures based on the feature spaces of convolutional neural networks optimised for object recognition. Samples from the model are of high perceptual quality demonstrating the generative power of neural networks trained in a purely discriminative fashion. Within the model, textures are represented by the correlations between feature maps in several layers of the network. We show that across layers the texture representations increasingly capture the statistical properties of natural images while making object information more and more explicit. The model provides a new tool to generate stimuli for neuroscience and might offer insights into the deep representations learned by convolutional neural networks.  
Efficient and robust algorithms for decentralized estimation in networks are essential to many distributed systems. Whereas distributed estimation of sample mean statistics has been the subject of a good deal of attention, computation of U statistics, relying on more expensive averaging over pairs of observations, is a less investigated area. Yet, such data functionals are essential to describe global properties of a statistical population, with important examples including Area Under the Curve, empirical variance, Gini mean difference and within-cluster point scatter. This paper proposes new synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms which simultaneously propagate data across the network and maintain local estimates of the U -statistic of interest. We establish convergence rate bounds of O(1/t) and O(log t/t) for the synchronous and asynchronous cases respectively, where t is the number of iterations, with explicit data and network dependent terms. Beyond favorable comparisons in terms of rate analysis, numerical experiments provide empirical evidence the proposed algorithms surpasses the previously introduced approach.  
This paper presents a methodology for creating streaming, distributed inference algorithms for Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models. In the proposed framework, processing nodes receive a sequence of data minibatches, compute a variational posterior for each, and make asynchronous streaming updates to a central model. In contrast to previous algorithms, the proposed framework is truly streaming, distributed, asynchronous, learning-rate-free, and truncation-free. The key challenge in developing the framework, arising from the fact that BNP models do not impose an inherent ordering on their components, is finding the correspondence between minibatch and central BNP posterior components before performing each update. To address this, the paper develops a combinatorial optimization problem over component correspondences, and provides an efficient solution technique. The paper concludes with an application of the methodology to the DP mixture model, with experimental results demonstrating its practical scalability and performance.  
Although the human visual system can recognize many concepts under challenging conditions, it still has some biases. In this paper, we investigate whether we can extract these biases and transfer them into a machine recognition system. We introduce a novel method that, inspired by well-known tools in human psychophysics, estimates the biases that the human visual system might use for recognition, but in computer vision feature spaces. Our experiments are surprising, and suggest that classifiers from the human visual system can be transferred into a machine with some success. Since these classifiers seem to capture favorable biases in the human visual system, we further present an SVM formulation that constrains the orientation of the SVM hyperplane to agree with the bias from human visual system. Our results suggest that transferring this human bias into machines may help object recognition systems generalize across datasets and perform better when very little training data is available.  
Maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference is an important task for many applications. Although the standard formulation gives rise to a hard combinatorial optimization problem, several effective approximations have been proposed and studied in recent years. We focus on linear programming (LP) relaxations, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many applications. However, optimization of the resulting program is in general challenging due to non-smoothness and complex non-separable constraints. Therefore, in this work we study the benefits of augmenting the objective function of the relaxation with strong convexity. Specifically, we introduce strong convexity by adding a quadratic term to the LP relaxation objective. We provide theoretical guarantees for the resulting programs, bounding the difference between their optimal value and the original optimum. Further, we propose suitable optimization algorithms and analyze their convergence.  
A version of the dueling bandit problem is addressed in which a Condorcet winner may not exist. Two algorithms are proposed that instead seek to minimize regret with respect to the Copeland winner, which, unlike the Condorcet winner, is guaranteed to exist. The first, Copeland Confidence Bound (CCB), is designed for small numbers of arms, while the second, Scalable Copeland Bandits (SCB), works better for large-scale problems. We provide theoretical results bounding the regret accumulated by CCB and SCB, both substantially improving existing results. Such existing results either offer bounds of the form O(K log T ) but require restrictive assumptions, or offer bounds of the form O(K 2 log T ) without requiring such assumptions. Our results offer the best of both worlds: O(K log T ) bounds without restrictive assumptions.  
We introduce the concept of coverage risk as an error measure for density ridge estimation. The coverage risk generalizes the mean integrated square error to set estimation. We propose two risk estimators for the coverage risk and we show that we can select tuning parameters by minimizing the estimated risk. We study the rate of convergence for coverage risk and prove consistency of the risk estimators. We apply our method to three simulated datasets and to cosmology data. In all the examples, the proposed method successfully recover the underlying density structure.  
Class ambiguity is typical in image classification problems with a large number of classes. When classes are difficult to discriminate, it makes sense to allow k guesses and evaluate classifiers based on the top-k error instead of the standard zero-one loss. We propose top-k multiclass SVM as a direct method to optimize for top-k performance. Our generalization of the well-known multiclass SVM is based on a tight convex upper bound of the top-k error. We propose a fast optimization scheme based on an efficient projection onto the top-k simplex, which is of its own interest. Experiments on five datasets show consistent improvements in top-k accuracy compared to various baselines.   We propose the Ω-return as an alternative to the λ-return currently used by the TD(λ) family of algorithms. The benefit of the Ω-return is that it accounts for the correlation of different length returns. Because it is difficult to compute exactly, we suggest one way of approximating the Ω-return. We provide empirical studies that suggest that it is superior to the λ-return and γ-return for a variety of problems.  
Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (ONMF) aims to approximate a nonnegative matrix as the product of two k-dimensional nonnegative factors, one of which has orthonormal columns. It yields potentially useful data representations as superposition of disjoint parts, while it has been shown to work well for clustering tasks where traditional methods underperform. Existing algorithms rely mostly on heuristics, which despite their good empirical performance, lack provable performance guarantees. We present a new ONMF algorithm with provable approximation guarantees. For any constant dimension k, we obtain an additive EPTAS without any assumptions on the input. Our algorithm relies on a novel approximation to the related Nonnegative Principal Component Analysis (NNPCA) problem; given an arbitrary data matrix, NNPCA seeks k nonnegative components that jointly capture most of the variance. Our NNPCA algorithm is of independent interest and generalizes previous work that could only obtain guarantees for a single component. We evaluate our algorithms on several real and synthetic datasets and show that their performance matches or outperforms the state of the art.  
The greedy algorithm is extensively studied in the field of combinatorial optimization for decades. In this paper, we address the online learning problem when the input to the greedy algorithm is stochastic with unknown parameters that have to be learned over time. We first propose the greedy regret and -quasi greedy regret as learning metrics comparing with the performance of offline greedy algorithm. We then propose two online greedy learning algorithms with semi-bandit feedbacks, which use multi-armed bandit and pure exploration bandit policies at each level of greedy learning, one for each of the regret metrics respectively. Both algorithms achieve O(log T ) problem-dependent regret bound (T being the time horizon) for a general class of combinatorial structures and reward functions that allow greedy solutions. We further show that the bound is tight in T and other problem instance parameters.  
Deep structured output learning shows great promise in tasks like semantic image segmentation. We proffer a new, efficient deep structured model learning scheme, in which we show how deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to directly estimate the messages in message passing inference for structured prediction with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). With such CNN message estimators, we obviate the need to learn or evaluate potential functions for message calculation. This confers significant efficiency for learning, since otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient iteration. The network output dimension of message estimators is the same as the number of classes, rather than exponentially growing in the order of the potentials. Hence it is more scalable for cases that involve a large number of classes. We apply our method to semantic image segmentation and achieve impressive performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of our CNN message learning method.  
We reexamine in this article the conceptual and mathematical framework for understanding the organization of plasticity in spiking neural networks. We propose that inherent stochasticity enables synaptic plasticity to carry out probabilistic inference by sampling from a posterior distribution of synaptic parameters. This view provides a viable alternative to existing models that propose convergence of synaptic weights to maximum likelihood parameters. It explains how priors on weight distributions and connection probabilities can be merged optimally with learned experience. In simulations we show that our model for synaptic plasticity allows spiking neural networks to compensate continuously for unforeseen disturbances. Furthermore it provides a normative mathematical framework to better understand the permanent variability and rewiring observed in brain networks.  
Nonconvex and nonsmooth problems have recently received considerable attention in signal/image processing, statistics and machine learning. However, solving the nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems remains a big challenge. Accelerated proximal gradient (APG) is an excellent method for convex programming. However, it is still unknown whether the usual APG can ensure the convergence to a critical point in nonconvex programming. In this paper, we extend APG for general nonconvex and nonsmooth programs by introducing a monitor that satisfies the sufficient descent property. Accordingly, we propose a monotone APG and a nonmonotone APG. The latter waives the requirement on monotonic reduction of the objective function and needs less computation in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide APG-type algorithms for general nonconvex and nonsmooth problems ensuring that every  accumulation point is a critical point, and the convergence rates remain O k12 when the problems are convex, in which k is the number of iterations. Numerical results testify to the advantage of our algorithms in speed.  
We study how well one can recover sparse principal components of a data matrix using a sketch formed from a few of its elements. We show that for a wide class of optimization problems, if the sketch is close (in the spectral norm) to the original data matrix, then one can recover a near optimal solution to the optimization problem by using the sketch. In particular, we use this approach to obtain sparse principal components and show that for m data points in n dimensions, O(−2 k̃ max{m, n}) elements gives an -additive approximation to the sparse PCA problem (k̃ is the stable rank of the data matrix). We demonstrate our algorithms extensively on image, text, biological and financial data. The results show that not only are we able to recover the sparse PCAs from the incomplete data, but by using our sparse sketch, the running time drops by a factor of five or more.  
We propose and analyse estimators for statistical functionals of one or more distributions under nonparametric assumptions. Our estimators are derived from the von Mises expansion and are based on the theory of influence functions, which appear in the semiparametric statistics literature. We show that estimators based either on data-splitting or a leave-one-out technique enjoy fast rates of convergence and other favorable theoretical properties. We apply this framework to derive estimators for several popular information theoretic quantities, and via empirical evaluation, show the advantage of this approach over existing estimators.  
Selecting a good column (or row) subset of massive data matrices has found many applications in data analysis and machine learning. We propose a new adaptive sampling algorithm that can be used to improve any relative-error column selection algorithm. Our algorithm delivers a tighter theoretical bound on the approximation error which we also demonstrate empirically using two well known relative-error column subset selection algorithms. Our experimental results on synthetic and real-world data show that our algorithm outperforms non-adaptive sampling as well as prior adaptive sampling approaches.  
Recent years have witnessed the superiority of non-convex sparse learning formulations over their convex counterparts in both theory and practice. However, due to the non-convexity and non-smoothness of the regularizer, how to efficiently solve the non-convex optimization problem for large-scale data is still quite challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient Hybrid Optimization algorithm for NOn-convex Regularized problems (HONOR). Specifically, we develop a hybrid scheme which effectively integrates a Quasi-Newton (QN) step and a Gradient Descent (GD) step. Our contributions are as follows: (1) HONOR incorporates the second-order information to greatly speed up the convergence, while it avoids solving a regularized quadratic programming and only involves matrixvector multiplications without explicitly forming the inverse Hessian matrix. (2) We establish a rigorous convergence analysis for HONOR, which shows that convergence is guaranteed even for non-convex problems, while it is typically challenging to analyze the convergence for non-convex problems. (3) We conduct empirical studies on large-scale data sets and results demonstrate that HONOR converges significantly faster than state-of-the-art algorithms.  
The goal of this paper is to generate high-quality 3D object proposals in the context of autonomous driving. Our method exploits stereo imagery to place proposals in the form of 3D bounding boxes. We formulate the problem as minimizing an energy function encoding object size priors, ground plane as well as several depth informed features that reason about free space, point cloud densities and distance to the ground. Our experiments show significant performance gains over existing RGB and RGB-D object proposal methods on the challenging KITTI benchmark. Combined with convolutional neural net (CNN) scoring, our approach outperforms all existing results on all three KITTI object classes.
We study contextual bandits with budget and time constraints, referred to as constrained contextual bandits. The time and budget constraints significantly complicate the exploration and exploitation tradeoff because they introduce complex coupling among contexts over time. To gain insight, we first study unit-cost systems with known context distribution. When the expected rewards are known, we develop an approximation of the oracle, referred to Adaptive-Linear-Programming (ALP), which achieves near-optimality and only requires the ordering of expected rewards. With these highly desirable features, we then combine ALP with the upper-confidence-bound (UCB) method in the general case where the expected rewards are unknown a priori. We show that the proposed UCB-ALP algorithm achieves logarithmic regret except for certain boundary cases. Further, we design algorithms and obtain similar regret bounds for more general systems with unknown context distribution and heterogeneous costs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows how to achieve logarithmic regret in constrained contextual bandits. Moreover, this work also sheds light on the study of computationally efficient algorithms for general constrained contextual bandits.  
Deep neural networks currently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in several domains. At the same time, models of this class are very demanding in terms of computational resources. In particular, a large amount of memory is required by commonly used fully-connected layers, making it hard to use the models on low-end devices and stopping the further increase of the model size. In this paper we convert the dense weight matrices of the fully-connected layers to the Tensor Train [17] format such that the number of parameters is reduced by a huge factor and at the same time the expressive power of the layer is preserved. In particular, for the Very Deep VGG networks [21] we report the compression factor of the dense weight matrix of a fully-connected layer up to 200000 times leading to the compression factor of the whole network up to 7 times.  
The modern scale of data has brought new challenges to Bayesian inference. In particular, conventional MCMC algorithms are computationally very expensive for large data sets. A promising approach to solve this problem is embarrassingly parallel MCMC (EP-MCMC), which first partitions the data into multiple subsets and runs independent sampling algorithms on each subset. The subset posterior draws are then aggregated via some combining rules to obtain the final approximation. Existing EP-MCMC algorithms are limited by approximation accuracy and difficulty in resampling. In this article, we propose a new EP-MCMC algorithm PART that solves these problems. The new algorithm applies random partition trees to combine the subset posterior draws, which is distribution-free, easy to resample from and can adapt to multiple scales. We provide theoretical justification and extensive experiments illustrating empirical performance.  
Multi-subject fMRI data is critical for evaluating the generality and validity of findings across subjects, and its effective utilization helps improve analysis sensitivity. We develop a shared response model for aggregating multi-subject fMRI data that accounts for different functional topographies among anatomically aligned datasets. Our model demonstrates improved sensitivity in identifying a shared response for a variety of datasets and anatomical brain regions of interest. Furthermore, by removing the identified shared response, it allows improved detection of group differences. The ability to identify what is shared and what is not shared opens the model to a wide range of multi-subject fMRI studies.
We develop a latent variable model and an efﬁcient spectral algorithm motivated by the recent emergence of very large data sets of chromatin marks from multiple human cell types. A natural model for chromatin data in one cell type is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM); we model the relationship between multiple cell types by connecting their hidden states by a ﬁxed tree of known structure. The main challenge with learning parameters of such models is that iterative methods such as EM are very slow, while naive spectral methods result in time and space complexity exponential in the number of cell types. We exploit properties of the tree structure of the hidden states to provide spectral algorithms that are more computationally efﬁcient for current biological datasets. We provide sample complexity bounds for our algorithm and evaluate it experimentally on biological data from nine human cell types. Finally, we show that beyond our speciﬁc model, some of our algorithmic ideas can be applied to other graphical models.  
This paper provides the ﬁrst formalization of self-interested planning in multiagent settings using expectation-maximization (EM). Our formalization in the context of inﬁnite-horizon and ﬁnitely-nested interactive POMDPs (I-POMDP) is distinct from EM formulations for POMDPs and cooperative multiagent planning frameworks. We exploit the graphical model structure speciﬁc to I-POMDPs, and present a new approach based on block-coordinate descent for further speed up. Forward ﬁltering-backward sampling – a combination of exact ﬁltering with sampling – is explored to exploit problem structure.  
Mixture modeling is a general technique for making any simple model more expressive through weighted combination. This generality and simplicity in part explains the success of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in which updates are easy to derive for a wide class of mixture models. However, the likelihood of a mixture model is non-convex, so EM has no known global convergence guarantees. Recently, method of moments approaches offer global guarantees for some mixture models, but they do not extend easily to the range of mixture models that exist. In this work, we present Polymom, an unifying framework based on method of moments in which estimation procedures are easily derivable, just as in EM. Polymom is applicable when the moments of a single mixture component are polynomials of the parameters. Our key observation is that the moments of the mixture model are a mixture of these polynomials, which allows us to cast estimation as a Generalized Moment Problem. We solve its relaxations using semidefinite optimization, and then extract parameters using ideas from computer algebra. This framework allows us to draw insights and apply tools from convex optimization, computer algebra and the theory of moments to study problems in statistical estimation. Simulations show good empirical performance on several models.  
The Frank-Wolfe (FW) optimization algorithm has lately re-gained popularity thanks in particular to its ability to nicely handle the structured constraints appearing in machine learning applications. However, its convergence rate is known to be slow (sublinear) when the solution lies at the boundary. A simple lessknown fix is to add the possibility to take ‘away steps’ during optimization, an operation that importantly does not require a feasibility oracle. In this paper, we highlight and clarify several variants of the Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm that have been successfully applied in practice: away-steps FW, pairwise FW, fully-corrective FW and Wolfe’s minimum norm point algorithm, and prove for the first time that they all enjoy global linear convergence, under a weaker condition than strong convexity of the objective. The constant in the convergence rate has an elegant interpretation as the product of the (classical) condition number of the function with a novel geometric quantity that plays the role of a ‘condition number’ of the constraint set. We provide pointers to where these algorithms have made a difference in practice, in particular with the flow polytope, the marginal polytope and the base polytope for submodular optimization.  
Knowledge tracing—where a machine models the knowledge of a student as they interact with coursework—is a well established problem in computer supported education. Though effectively modeling student knowledge would have high educational impact, the task has many inherent challenges. In this paper we explore the utility of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model student learning. The RNN family of models have important advantages over previous methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain knowledge, and can capture more complex representations of student knowledge. Using neural networks results in substantial improvements in prediction performance on a range of knowledge tracing datasets. Moreover the learned model can be used for intelligent curriculum design and allows straightforward interpretation and discovery of structure in student tasks. These results suggest a promising new line of research for knowledge tracing and an exemplary application task for RNNs.  
We consider moment matching techniques for estimation in latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). By drawing explicit links between LDA and discrete versions of independent component analysis (ICA), we first derive a new set of cumulantbased tensors, with an improved sample complexity. Moreover, we reuse standard ICA techniques such as joint diagonalization of tensors to improve over existing methods based on the tensor power method. In an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we show that our new combination of tensors and orthogonal joint diagonalization techniques outperforms existing moment matching methods.
We propose a robust and efficient approach to the problem of compressive phase retrieval in which the goal is to reconstruct a sparse vector from the magnitude of a number of its linear measurements. The proposed framework relies on constrained sensing vectors and a two-stage reconstruction method that consists of two standard convex programs that are solved sequentially. In recent years, various methods are proposed for compressive phase retrieval, but they have suboptimal sample complexity or lack robustness guarantees. The main obstacle has been that there is no straightforward convex relaxations for the type of structure in the target. Given a set of underdetermined measurements, there is a standard framework for recovering a sparse matrix, and a standard framework for recovering a low-rank matrix. However, a general, efficient method for recovering a jointly sparse and low-rank matrix has remained elusive. Deviating from the models with generic measurements, in this paper we show that if the sensing vectors are chosen at random from an incoherent subspace, then the low-rank and sparse structures of the target signal can be effectively decoupled. We show that a recovery algorithm that consists of a low-rank recovery stage followed by a sparse recovery stage will produce an accurate estimate of the target when the number of measurements is O(k log kd ), where k and d denote the sparsity level and the dimension of the input signal. We also evaluate the algorithm through numerical simulation.  
We introduce a globally-convergent algorithm for optimizing the tree-reweighted (TRW) variational objective over the marginal polytope. The algorithm is based on the conditional gradient method (Frank-Wolfe) and moves pseudomarginals within the marginal polytope through repeated maximum a posteriori (MAP) calls. This modular structure enables us to leverage black-box MAP solvers (both exact and approximate) for variational inference, and obtains more accurate results than tree-reweighted algorithms that optimize over the local consistency relaxation. Theoretically, we bound the sub-optimality for the proposed algorithm despite the TRW objective having unbounded gradients at the boundary of the marginal polytope. Empirically, we demonstrate the increased quality of results found by tightening the relaxation over the marginal polytope as well as the spanning tree polytope on synthetic and real-world instances.  
We present data-dependent learning bounds for the general scenario of nonstationary non-mixing stochastic processes. Our learning guarantees are expressed in terms of a data-dependent measure of sequential complexity and a discrepancy measure that can be estimated from data under some mild assumptions. We use our learning bounds to devise new algorithms for non-stationary time series forecasting for which we report some preliminary experimental results.  
Spectral embedding based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a widely used “preprocessing” step in many learning tasks, typically leading to dimensionality reduction by projecting onto a number of dominant singular vectors and rescaling the coordinate axes (by a predefined function of the singular value). However, the number of such vectors required to capture problem structure grows with problem size, and even partial SVD computation becomes a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity compressive spectral embedding algorithm, which employs random projections and finite order polynomial expansions to compute approximations to SVD-based embedding. For an m×n matrix with T non-zeros, its time complexity is O ((T + m + n) log(m + n)), and the embedding dimension is O(log(m + n)), both of which are independent of the number of singular vectors whose effect we wish to capture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to circumvent this dependence on the number of singular vectors for general SVD-based embeddings. The key to sidestepping the SVD is the observation that, for downstream inference tasks such as clustering and classification, we are only interested in using the resulting embedding to evaluate pairwise similarity metrics derived from the ℓ2 -norm, rather than capturing the effect of the underlying matrix on arbitrary vectors as a partial SVD tries to do. Our numerical results on network datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, and motivate further exploration of its application to large-scale inference tasks.  
We study the estimation of low rank matrices via nonconvex optimization. Compared with convex relaxation, nonconvex optimization exhibits superior empirical performance for large scale instances of low rank matrix estimation. However, the understanding of its theoretical guarantees are limited. In this paper, we define the notion of projected oracle divergence based on which we establish sufficient conditions for the success of nonconvex optimization. We illustrate the consequences of this general framework for matrix sensing. In particular, we prove that a broad class of nonconvex optimization algorithms, including alternating minimization and gradient-type methods, geometrically converge to the global optimum and exactly recover the true low rank matrices under standard conditions.   Variational inference is a scalable technique for approximate Bayesian inference. Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious model-specific calculations; this makes it difficult for non-experts to use. We propose an automatic variational inference algorithm, automatic differentiation variational inference ( ); we implement it in Stan (code available), a probabilistic programming system. In the user provides a Bayesian model and a dataset, nothing else. We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the variational objective. We compare to sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. We train the mixture model on a quarter million images. With we can use variational inference on any model we write in Stan.  
Recurrent sequence generators conditioned on input data through an attention mechanism have recently shown very good performance on a range of tasks including machine translation, handwriting synthesis [1, 2] and image caption generation [3]. We extend the attention-mechanism with features needed for speech recognition. We show that while an adaptation of the model used for machine translation in [2] reaches a competitive 18.7% phoneme error rate (PER) on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, it can only be applied to utterances which are roughly as long as the ones it was trained on. We offer a qualitative explanation of this failure and propose a novel and generic method of adding location-awareness to the attention mechanism to alleviate this issue. The new method yields a model that is robust to long inputs and achieves 18% PER in single utterances and 20% in 10-times longer (repeated) utterances. Finally, we propose a change to the attention mechanism that prevents it from concentrating too much on single frames, which further reduces PER to 17.6% level.  
We propose a class of closed-form estimators for GLMs under high-dimensional sampling regimes. Our class of estimators is based on deriving closed-form variants of the vanilla unregularized MLE but which are (a) well-defined even under high-dimensional settings, and (b) available in closed-form. We then perform thresholding operations on this MLE variant to obtain our class of estimators. We derive a unified statistical analysis of our class of estimators, and show that it enjoys strong statistical guarantees in both parameter error as well as variable selection, that surprisingly match those of the more complex regularized GLM MLEs, even while our closed-form estimators are computationally much simpler. We derive instantiations of our class of closed-form estimators, as well as corollaries of our general theorem, for the special cases of logistic, exponential and Poisson regression models. We corroborate the surprising statistical and computational performance of our class of estimators via extensive simulations.  
The F-measure is an important and commonly used performance metric for binary prediction tasks. By combining precision and recall into a single score, it avoids disadvantages of simple metrics like the error rate, especially in cases of imbalanced class distributions. The problem of optimizing the F-measure, that is, of developing learning algorithms that perform optimally in the sense of this measure, has recently been tackled by several authors. In this paper, we study the problem of F-measure maximization in the setting of online learning. We propose an efﬁcient online algorithm and provide a formal analysis of its convergence properties. Moreover, ﬁrst experimental results are presented, showing that our method performs well in practice.   We study the problem of online rank elicitation, assuming that rankings of a set of alternatives obey the Plackett-Luce distribution. Following the setting of the dueling bandits problem, the learner is allowed to query pairwise comparisons between alternatives, i.e., to sample pairwise marginals of the distribution in an online fashion. Using this information, the learner seeks to reliably predict the most probable ranking (or top-alternative). Our approach is based on constructing a surrogate probability distribution over rankings based on a sorting procedure, for which the pairwise marginals provably coincide with the marginals of the PlackettLuce distribution. In addition to a formal performance and complexity analysis, we present first experimental studies.  
We consider the problem of finding M best diverse solutions of energy minimization problems for graphical models. Contrary to the sequential method of Batra et al., which greedily finds one solution after another, we infer all M solutions jointly. It was shown recently that such jointly inferred labelings not only have smaller total energy but also qualitatively outperform the sequentially obtained ones. The only obstacle for using this new technique is the complexity of the corresponding inference problem, since it is considerably slower algorithm than the method of Batra et al. In this work we show that the joint inference of M best diverse solutions can be formulated as a submodular energy minimization if the original MAP-inference problem is submodular, hence fast inference techniques can be used. In addition to the theoretical results we provide practical algorithms that outperform the current state-of-the-art and can be used in both submodular and non-submodular case.  
Both learning and inference tasks on Bayesian networks are NP-hard in general. Bounded tree-width Bayesian networks have recently received a lot of attention as a way to circumvent this complexity issue; however, while inference on bounded tree-width networks is tractable, the learning problem remains NP-hard even for tree-width 2. In this paper, we propose bounded vertex cover number Bayesian networks as an alternative to bounded tree-width networks. In particular, we show that both inference and learning can be done in polynomial time for any fixed vertex cover number bound k, in contrast to the general and bounded tree-width cases; on the other hand, we also show that learning problem is W[1]-hard in parameter k. Furthermore, we give an alternative way to learn bounded vertex cover number Bayesian networks using integer linear programming (ILP), and show this is feasible in practice.  
In this paper, we address the question of identifiability and learning algorithms for large-scale Poisson Directed Acyclic Graphical (DAG) models. We define general Poisson DAG models as models where each node is a Poisson random variable with rate parameter depending on the values of the parents in the underlying DAG. First, we prove that Poisson DAG models are identifiable from observational data, and present a polynomial-time algorithm that learns the Poisson DAG model under suitable regularity conditions. The main idea behind our algorithm is based on overdispersion, in that variables that are conditionally Poisson are overdispersed relative to variables that are marginally Poisson. Our algorithms exploits overdispersion along with methods for learning sparse Poisson undirected graphical models for faster computation. We provide both theoretical guarantees and simulation results for both small and large-scale DAGs.  
Restricted Boltzmann machines are undirected neural networks which have been shown to be effective in many applications, including serving as initializations for training deep multi-layer neural networks. One of the main reasons for their success is the existence of efficient and practical stochastic algorithms, such as contrastive divergence, for unsupervised training. We propose an alternative deterministic iterative procedure based on an improved mean field method from statistical physics known as the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer approach. We demonstrate that our algorithm provides performance equal to, and sometimes superior to, persistent contrastive divergence, while also providing a clear and easy to evaluate objective function. We believe that this strategy can be easily generalized to other models as well as to more accurate higher-order approximations, paving the way for systematic improvements in training Boltzmann machines with hidden units.  
This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level convolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification. We constructed several largescale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are offered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.  
A wide spectrum of discriminative methods is increasingly used in diverse applications for classification or regression tasks. However, many existing discriminative methods assume that the input data is nearly noise-free, which limits their applications to solve real-world problems. Particularly for disease diagnosis, the data acquired by the neuroimaging devices are always prone to different sources of noise. Robust discriminative models are somewhat scarce and only a few attempts have been made to make them robust against noise or outliers. These methods focus on detecting either the sample-outliers or feature-noises. Moreover, they usually use unsupervised de-noising procedures, or separately de-noise the training and the testing data. All these factors may induce biases in the learning process, and thus limit its performance. In this paper, we propose a classification method based on the least-squares formulation of linear discriminant analysis, which simultaneously detects the sample-outliers and feature-noises. The proposed method operates under a semi-supervised setting, in which both labeled training and unlabeled testing data are incorporated to form the intrinsic geometry of the sample space. Therefore, the violating samples or feature values are identified as sample-outliers or feature-noises, respectively. We test our algorithm on one synthetic and two brain neurodegenerative databases (particularly for Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease). The results demonstrate that our method outperforms all baseline and state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both accuracy and the area under the ROC curve.  
We study the problem of black-box optimization of a function f of any dimension, given function evaluations perturbed by noise. The function is assumed to be locally smooth around one of its global optima, but this smoothness is unknown. Our contribution is an adaptive optimization algorithm, POO or parallel optimistic optimization, that is able to deal with this setting. POO performs almost as well as the best known algorithms requiring the knowledge of the smoothness. Furthermore, POO works for a larger class of functions than what was previously considered, especially for functions that are difficult to optimize, in a very precise sense. We provide a finite-time analysis of POO’s√performance, which shows that its error after n evaluations is at most a factor of ln n away from the error of the best known optimization algorithms using the knowledge of the smoothness.  
The stochastic block model (SBM) has recently gathered significant attention due to new threshold phenomena. However, most developments rely on the knowledge of the model parameters, or at least on the number of communities. This paper introduces efficient algorithms that do not require such knowledge and yet achieve the optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs identified in Abbe-Sandon FOCS15. In the constant degree regime, an algorithm is developed that requires only a lower-bound on the relative sizes of the communities and achieves the optimal accuracy scaling for large degrees. This lower-bound requirement is removed for the regime of arbitrarily slowly diverging degrees, and the model parameters are learned efficiently. For the logarithmic degree regime, this is further enhanced into a fully agnostic algorithm that achieves the CH-limit for exact recovery in quasilinear time. These provide the first algorithms affording efficiency, universality and information-theoretic optimality for strong and weak consistency in the SBM.  
We study the problem of stochastic optimization for deep learning in the parallel computing environment under communication constraints. A new algorithm is proposed in this setting where the communication and coordination of work among concurrent processes (local workers), is based on an elastic force which links the parameters they compute with a center variable stored by the parameter server (master). The algorithm enables the local workers to perform more exploration, i.e. the algorithm allows the local variables to fluctuate further from the center variable by reducing the amount of communication between local workers and the master. We empirically demonstrate that in the deep learning setting, due to the existence of many local optima, allowing more exploration can lead to the improved performance. We propose synchronous and asynchronous variants of the new algorithm. We provide the stability analysis of the asynchronous variant in the round-robin scheme and compare it with the more common parallelized method ADMM. We show that the stability of EASGD is guaranteed when a simple stability condition is satisfied, which is not the case for ADMM. We additionally propose the momentum-based version of our algorithm that can be applied in both synchronous and asynchronous settings. Asynchronous variant of the algorithm is applied to train convolutional neural networks for image classification on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. Experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm accelerates the training of deep architectures compared to DOWNPOUR and other common baseline approaches and furthermore is very communication efficient.  
A k-submodular function is a generalization of a submodular function, where the input consists of k disjoint subsets, instead of a single subset, of the domain. Many machine learning problems, including influence maximization with k kinds of topics and sensor placement with k kinds of sensors, can be naturally modeled as the problem of maximizing monotone k-submodular functions. In this paper, we give constant-factor approximation algorithms for maximizing monotone ksubmodular functions subject to several size constraints. The running time of our algorithms are almost linear in the domain size. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baseline algorithms in terms of the solution quality.  
An active learner is given a hypothesis class, a large set of unlabeled examples and the ability to interactively query labels to an oracle of a subset of these examples; the goal of the learner is to learn a hypothesis in the class that ﬁts the data well by making as few label queries as possible. This work addresses active learning with labels obtained from strong and weak labelers, where in addition to the standard active learning setting, we have an extra weak labeler which may occasionally provide incorrect labels. An example is learning to classify medical images where either expensive labels may be obtained from a physician (oracle or strong labeler), or cheaper but occasionally incorrect labels may be obtained from a medical resident (weak labeler). Our goal is to learn a classiﬁer with low error on data labeled by the oracle, while using the weak labeler to reduce the number of label queries made to this labeler. We provide an active learning algorithm for this setting, establish its statistical consistency, and analyze its label complexity to characterize when it can provide label savings over using the strong labeler alone.  
To capture the interdependencies between labels in multi-label classification problems, classifier chain (CC) tries to take the multiple labels of each instance into account under a deterministic high-order Markov Chain model. Since its performance is sensitive to the choice of label order, the key issue is how to determine the optimal label order for CC. In this work, we first generalize the CC model over a random label order. Then, we present a theoretical analysis of the generalization error for the proposed generalized model. Based on our results, we propose a dynamic programming based classifier chain (CC-DP) algorithm to search the globally optimal label order for CC and a greedy classifier chain (CC-Greedy) algorithm to find a locally optimal CC. Comprehensive experiments on a number of real-world multi-label data sets from various domains demonstrate that our proposed CC-DP algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and the CCGreedy algorithm achieves comparable prediction performance with CC-DP.  
We study the problem of Robust Least Squares Regression (RLSR) where several response variables can be adversarially corrupted. More specifically, for a data matrix X ∈ Rp×n and an underlying model w∗ , the response vector is generated as y = X T w∗ + b where b ∈ Rn is the corruption vector supported over at most C · n coordinates. Existing exact recovery results for RLSR focus solely on L1 penalty based convex formulations and impose relatively strict model assumptions such as requiring the corruptions b to be selected independently of X. In this work, we study a simple hard-thresholding algorithm called TORRENT which, under mild conditions on X, can recover w∗ exactly even if b corrupts the response variables in an adversarial manner, i.e. both the support and entries of b are selected adversarially after observing X and w∗ . Our results hold under deterministic assumptions which are satisfied if X is sampled from any sub-Gaussian distribution. Finally unlike existing results that apply only to a fixed w∗ , generated independently of X, our results are universal and hold for any w∗ ∈ Rp . Next, we propose gradient descent-based extensions of TORRENT that can scale efficiently to large scale problems, such as high dimensional sparse recovery. and prove similar recovery guarantees for these extensions. Empirically we find T OR RENT , and more so its extensions, offering significantly faster recovery than the state-of-the-art L1 solvers. For instance, even on moderate-sized datasets (with p = 50K) with around 40% corrupted responses, a variant of our proposed method called T ORRENT-HYB is more than 20× faster than the best L1 solver. “If among these errors are some which appear too large to be admissible, then those equations which produced these errors will be rejected, as coming from too faulty experiments, and the unknowns will be determined by means of the other equations, which will then give much smaller errors.” A. M. Legendre, On the Method of Least Squares. 1805.  
The objective in extreme multi-label learning is to train a classifier that can automatically tag a novel data point with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. Embedding based approaches attempt to make training and prediction tractable by assuming that the training label matrix is low-rank and reducing the effective number of labels by projecting the high dimensional label vectors onto a low dimensional linear subspace. Still, leading embedding approaches have been unable to deliver high prediction accuracies, or scale to large problems as the low rank assumption is violated in most real world applications. In this paper we develop the SLEEC classifier to address both limitations. The main technical contribution in SLEEC is a formulation for learning a small ensemble of local distance preserving embeddings which can accurately predict infrequently occurring (tail) labels. This allows SLEEC to break free of the traditional low-rank assumption and boost classification accuracy by learning embeddings which preserve pairwise distances between only the nearest label vectors. We conducted extensive experiments on several real-world, as well as benchmark data sets and compared our method against state-of-the-art methods for extreme multi-label classification. Experiments reveal that SLEEC can make significantly more accurate predictions then the state-of-the-art methods including both embedding-based (by as much as 35%) as well as tree-based (by as much as 6%) methods. SLEEC can also scale efficiently to data sets with a million labels which are beyond the pale of leading embedding methods.  
This paper is concerned with finding a solution x to a quadratic system of equations yi = |hai , xi|2 , i = 1, . . . , m. We demonstrate that it is possible to solve unstructured random quadratic systems in n variables exactly from O(n) equations in linear time, that is, in time proportional to reading the data {ai } and {yi }. This is accomplished by a novel procedure, which starting from an initial guess given by a spectral initialization procedure, attempts to minimize a nonconvex objective. The proposed algorithm distinguishes from prior approaches by regularizing the initialization and descent procedures in an adaptive fashion, which discard terms bearing too much influence on the initial estimate or search directions. These careful selection rules—which effectively serve as a variance reduction scheme—provide a tighter initial guess, more robust descent directions, and thus enhanced practical performance. Further, this procedure also achieves a nearoptimal statistical accuracy in the presence of noise. Empirically, we demonstrate that the computational cost of our algorithm is about four times that of solving a least-squares problem of the same size.  
For many complex diseases, there is a wide variety of ways in which an individual can manifest the disease. The challenge of personalized medicine is to develop tools that can accurately predict the trajectory of an individual’s disease, which can in turn enable clinicians to optimize treatments. We represent an individual’s disease trajectory as a continuous-valued continuous-time function describing the severity of the disease over time. We propose a hierarchical latent variable model that individualizes predictions of disease trajectories. This model shares statistical strength across observations at different resolutions–the population, subpopulation and the individual level. We describe an algorithm for learning population and subpopulation parameters offline, and an online procedure for dynamically learning individual-specific parameters. Finally, we validate our model on the task of predicting the course of interstitial lung disease, a leading cause of death among patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art and demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy.  
This paper considers the subspace clustering problem where the data contains irrelevant or corrupted features. We propose a method termed “robust Dantzig selector” which can successfully identify the clustering structure even with the presence of irrelevant features. The idea is simple yet powerful: we replace the inner product by its robust counterpart, which is insensitive to the irrelevant features given an upper bound of the number of irrelevant features. We establish theoretical guarantees for the algorithm to identify the correct subspace, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm via numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method developed to tackle subspace clustering with irrelevant features.  
We consider the following multi-component sparse PCA problem: given a set of data points, we seek to extract a small number of sparse components with disjoint supports that jointly capture the maximum possible variance. Such components can be computed one by one, repeatedly solving the single-component problem and deflating the input data matrix, but this greedy procedure is suboptimal. We present a novel algorithm for sparse PCA that jointly optimizes multiple disjoint components. The extracted features capture variance that lies within a multiplicative factor arbitrarily close to 1 from the optimal. Our algorithm is combinatorial and computes the desired components by solving multiple instances of the bipartite maximum weight matching problem. Its complexity grows as a low order polynomial in the ambient dimension of the input data, but exponentially in its rank. However, it can be effectively applied on a low-dimensional sketch of the input data. We evaluate our algorithm on real datasets and empirically demonstrate that in many cases it outperforms existing, deflation-based approaches.  
One approach to improving the running time of kernel-based methods is to build a small sketch of the kernel matrix and use it in lieu of the full matrix in the machine learning task of interest. Here, we describe a version of this approach that comes with running time guarantees as well as improved guarantees on its statistical performance. By extending the notion of statistical leverage scores to the setting of kernel ridge regression, we are able to identify a sampling distribution that reduces the size of the sketch (i.e., the required number of columns to be sampled) to the effective dimensionality of the problem. This latter quantity is often much smaller than previous bounds that depend on the maximal degrees of freedom. We give an empirical evidence supporting this fact. Our second contribution is to present a fast algorithm to quickly compute coarse approximations to these scores in time linear in the number of samples. More precisely, the running time of the algorithm is O(np2 ) with p only depending on the trace of the kernel matrix and the regularization parameter. This is obtained via a variant of squared length sampling that we adapt to the kernel setting. Lastly, we discuss how this new notion of the leverage of a data point captures a fine notion of the difficulty of the learning problem.  
The framework of online learning with memory naturally captures learning problems with temporal effects, and was previously studied for the experts setting. In this work we extend the notion of learning with memory to the general Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework, and present two algorithms that attain low regret. The first algorithm applies to Lipschitz continuous loss functions, obtaining optimal regret bounds for both convex and strongly convex losses. The second algorithm attains the optimal regret bounds and applies more broadly to convex losses without requiring Lipschitz continuity, yet is more complicated to implement. We complement the theoretical results with two applications: statistical arbitrage in finance, and multi-step ahead prediction in statistics.  
Subunit models provide a powerful yet parsimonious description of neural responses to complex stimuli. They are defined by a cascade of two linear-nonlinear (LN) stages, with the first stage defined by a linear convolution with one or more filters and common point nonlinearity, and the second by pooling weights and an output nonlinearity. Recent interest in such models has surged due to their biological plausibility and accuracy for characterizing early sensory responses. However, fitting poses a difficult computational challenge due to the expense of evaluating the log-likelihood and the ubiquity of local optima. Here we address this problem by providing a theoretical connection between spike-triggered covariance analysis and nonlinear subunit models. Specifically, we show that a “convolutional” decomposition of a spike-triggered average (STA) and covariance (STC) matrix provides an asymptotically efficient estimator for class of quadratic subunit models. We establish theoretical conditions for identifiability of the subunit and pooling weights, and show that our estimator performs well even in cases of model mismatch. Finally, we analyze neural data from macaque primary visual cortex and show that our moment-based estimator outperforms a highly regularized generalized quadratic model (GQM), and achieves nearly the same prediction performance as the full maximum-likelihood estimator, yet at substantially lower cost.  
The goal of precipitation nowcasting is to predict the future rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short period of time. Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-theart operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.  
High dimensional regression benefits from sparsity promoting regularizations. Screening rules leverage the known sparsity of the solution by ignoring some variables in the optimization, hence speeding up solvers. When the procedure is proven not to discard features wrongly the rules are said to be safe. In this paper we derive new safe rules for generalized linear models regularized with `1 and `1 {`2 norms. The rules are based on duality gap computations and spherical safe regions whose diameters converge to zero. This allows to discard safely more variables, in particular for low regularization parameters. The GAP Safe rule can cope with any iterative solver and we illustrate its performance on coordinate descent for multi-task Lasso, binary and multinomial logistic regression, demonstrating significant speed ups on all tested datasets with respect to previous safe rules.  
In this paper, we propose a novel parameter estimator for probabilistic models on discrete space. The proposed estimator is derived from minimization of homogeneous divergence and can be constructed without calculation of the normalization constant, which is frequently infeasible for models in the discrete space. We investigate statistical properties of the proposed estimator such as consistency and asymptotic normality, and reveal a relationship with the information geometry. Some experiments show that the proposed estimator attains comparable performance to the maximum likelihood estimator with drastically lower computational cost.  We propose an exploratory approach to statistical model criticism using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) two sample tests. Typical approaches to model criticism require a practitioner to select a statistic by which to measure discrepancies between data and a statistical model. MMD two sample tests are instead constructed as an analytic maximisation over a large space of possible statistics and therefore automatically select the statistic which most shows any discrepancy. We demonstrate on synthetic data that the selected statistic, called the witness function, can be used to identify where a statistical model most misrepresents the data it was trained on. We then apply the procedure to real data where the models being assessed are restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks and Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the ways in which these models fail to capture the properties of the data they are trained on.  
Precision-Recall analysis abounds in applications of binary classification where true negatives do not add value and hence should not affect assessment of the classifier’s performance. Perhaps inspired by the many advantages of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under such curves for accuracybased performance assessment, many researchers have taken to report PrecisionRecall (PR) curves and associated areas as performance metric. We demonstrate in this paper that this practice is fraught with difficulties, mainly because of incoherent scale assumptions – e.g., the area under a PR curve takes the arithmetic mean of precision values whereas the Fβ score applies the harmonic mean. We show how to fix this by plotting PR curves in a different coordinate system, and demonstrate that the new Precision-Recall-Gain curves inherit all key advantages of ROC curves. In particular, the area under Precision-Recall-Gain curves conveys an expected F1 score on a harmonic scale, and the convex hull of a PrecisionRecall-Gain curve allows us to calibrate the classifier’s scores so as to determine, for each operating point on the convex hull, the interval of β values for which the point optimises Fβ . We demonstrate experimentally that the area under traditional PR curves can easily favour models with lower expected F1 score than others, and so the use of Precision-Recall-Gain curves will result in better model selection.  
We consider a generalization of the submodular cover problem based on the concept of diminishing return property on the integer lattice. We are motivated by real scenarios in machine learning that cannot be captured by (traditional) submodular set functions. We show that the generalized submodular cover problem can be applied to various problems and devise a bicriteria approximation algorithm. Our algorithm is guaranteed to output a log-factor approximate solution that satisfies the constraints with the desired accuracy. The running time of our algorithm is roughly O(n log(nr) log r), where n is the size of the ground set and r is the maximum value of a coordinate. The dependency on r is exponentially better than the naive reduction algorithms. Several experiments on real and artificial datasets demonstrate that the solution quality of our algorithm is comparable to naive algorithms, while the running time is several orders of magnitude faster.  
Bidirectional recurrent neural networks (RNN) are trained to predict both in the positive and negative time directions simultaneously. They have not been used commonly in unsupervised tasks, because a probabilistic interpretation of the model has been difficult. Recently, two different frameworks, GSN and NADE, provide a connection between reconstruction and probabilistic modeling, which makes the interpretation possible. As far as we know, neither GSN or NADE have been studied in the context of time series before. As an example of an unsupervised task, we study the problem of filling in gaps in high-dimensional time series with complex dynamics. Although unidirectional RNNs have recently been trained successfully to model such time series, inference in the negative time direction is non-trivial. We propose two probabilistic interpretations of bidirectional RNNs that can be used to reconstruct missing gaps efficiently. Our experiments on text data show that both proposed methods are much more accurate than unidirectional reconstructions, although a bit less accurate than a computationally complex bidirectional Bayesian inference on the unidirectional RNN. We also provide results on music data for which the Bayesian inference is computationally infeasible,10demonstrating the scalability of the proposed methods  
We study the problem of minimizing the average of a large number of smooth convex functions penalized with a strongly convex regularizer. We propose and analyze a novel primal-dual method (Quartz) which at every iteration samples and updates a random subset of the dual variables, chosen according to an arbitrary distribution. In contrast to typical analysis, we directly bound the decrease of the primal-dual error (in expectation), without the need to first analyze the dual error. Depending on the choice of the sampling, we obtain efficient serial and mini-batch variants of the method. In the serial case, our bounds match the best known bounds for SDCA (both with uniform and importance sampling). With standard mini-batching, our bounds predict initial data-independent speedup as well as additional data-driven speedup which depends on spectral and sparsity properties of the data. Keywords: empirical risk minimization, dual coordinate ascent, arbitrary sampling, data-driven speedup.  
Inference is typically intractable in high-treewidth undirected graphical models, making maximum likelihood learning a challenge. One way to overcome this is to restrict parameters to a tractable set, most typically the set of tree-structured parameters. This paper explores an alternative notion of a tractable set, namely a set of “fast-mixing parameters” where Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference can be guaranteed to quickly converge to the stationary distribution. While it is common in practice to approximate the likelihood gradient using samples obtained from MCMC, such procedures lack theoretical guarantees. This paper proves that for any exponential family with bounded sufficient statistics, (not just graphical models) when parameters are constrained to a fast-mixing set, gradient descent with gradients approximated by sampling will approximate the maximum likelihood solution inside the set with high-probability. When unregularized, to find a solution ϵ-accurate in log-likelihood requires a total amount of effort cubic in 1/ϵ, disregarding logarithmic factors. When ridge-regularized, strong convexity allows a solution ϵ-accurate in parameter distance with effort quadratic in 1/ϵ. Both of these provide of a fully-polynomial time randomized approximation scheme.  
Multidimensional recurrent neural networks (MDRNNs) have shown a remarkable performance in the area of speech and handwriting recognition. The performance of an MDRNN is improved by further increasing its depth, and the difficulty of learning the deeper network is overcome by using Hessian-free (HF) optimization. Given that connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is utilized as an objective of learning an MDRNN for sequence labeling, the non-convexity of CTC poses a problem when applying HF to the network. As a solution, a convex approximation of CTC is formulated and its relationship with the EM algorithm and the Fisher information matrix is discussed. An MDRNN up to a depth of 15 layers is successfully trained using HF, resulting in an improved performance for sequence labeling.  
This paper studies theoretically and empirically a method of turning machinelearning algorithms into probabilistic predictors that automatically enjoys a property of validity (perfect calibration) and is computationally efficient. The price to pay for perfect calibration is that these probabilistic predictors produce imprecise (in practice, almost precise for large data sets) probabilities. When these imprecise probabilities are merged into precise probabilities, the resulting predictors, while losing the theoretical property of perfect calibration, are consistently more accurate than the existing methods in empirical studies.  
Deep learning has recently been introduced to the field of low-level computer vision and image processing. Promising results have been obtained in a number of tasks including super-resolution, inpainting, deconvolution, filtering, etc. However, previously adopted neural network approaches such as convolutional neural networks and sparse auto-encoders are inherently with translation invariant operators. We found this property prevents the deep learning approaches from outperforming the state-of-the-art if the task itself requires translation variant interpolation (TVI). In this paper, we draw on Shepard interpolation and design Shepard Convolutional Neural Networks (ShCNN) which efficiently realizes endto-end trainable TVI operators in the network. We show that by adding only a few feature maps in the new Shepard layers, the network is able to achieve stronger results than a much deeper architecture. Superior performance on both image inpainting and super-resolution is obtained where our system outperforms previous ones while keeping the running time competitive.  
We take a new look at parameter estimation for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMMs). Specifically, we advance Riemannian manifold optimization (on the manifold of positive definite matrices) as a potential replacement for Expectation Maximization (EM), which has been the de facto standard for decades. An out-of-the-box invocation of Riemannian optimization, however, fails spectacularly: it obtains the same solution as EM, but vastly slower. Building on intuition from geometric convexity, we propose a simple reformulation that has remarkable consequences: it makes Riemannian optimization not only match EM (a nontrivial result on its own, given the poor record nonlinear programming has had against EM), but also outperforms it in many settings. To bring our ideas to fruition, we develop a welltuned Riemannian LBFGS method that proves superior to known competing methods (e.g., Riemannian conjugate gradient). We hope that our results encourage a wider consideration of manifold optimization in machine learning and statistics.  
This paper presents a new semi-supervised framework with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for text categorization. Unlike the previous approaches that rely on word embeddings, our method learns embeddings of small text regions from unlabeled data for integration into a supervised CNN. The proposed scheme for embedding learning is based on the idea of two-view semi-supervised learning, which is intended to be useful for the task of interest even though the training is done on unlabeled data. Our models achieve better results than previous approaches on sentiment classification and topic classification tasks.  
The paper presents and evaluates the power of parallel search for exact MAP inference in graphical models. We introduce a new parallel shared-memory recursive best-first AND/OR search algorithm, called SPRBFAOO, that explores the search space in a best-first manner while operating with restricted memory. Our experiments show that SPRBFAOO is often superior to the current state-of-the-art sequential AND/OR search approaches, leading to considerable speed-ups (up to 7-fold with 12 threads), especially on hard problem instances.  
Scene labeling is a challenging computer vision task. It requires the use of both local discriminative features and global context information. We adopt a deep recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) for this task, which is originally proposed for object recognition. Different from traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN), this model has intra-layer recurrent connections in the convolutional layers. Therefore each convolutional layer becomes a two-dimensional recurrent neural network. The units receive constant feed-forward inputs from the previous layer and recurrent inputs from their neighborhoods. While recurrent iterations proceed, the region of context captured by each unit expands. In this way, feature extraction and context modulation are seamlessly integrated, which is different from typical methods that entail separate modules for the two steps. To further utilize the context, a multi-scale RCNN is proposed. Over two benchmark datasets, Standford Background and Sift Flow, the model outperforms many state-of-the-art models in accuracy and efficiency.  
Recently, there has been growing interest in systematic search-based and importance sampling-based lifted inference algorithms for statistical relational models (SRMs). These lifted algorithms achieve significant complexity reductions over their propositional counterparts by using lifting rules that leverage symmetries in the relational representation. One drawback of these algorithms is that they use an inference-blind representation of the search space, which makes it difficult to efficiently pre-compute tight upper bounds on the exact cost of inference without running the algorithm to completion. In this paper, we present a principled approach to address this problem. We introduce a lifted analogue of the propositional And/Or search space framework, which we call a lifted And/Or schematic. Given a schematic-based representation of an SRM, we show how to efficiently compute a tight upper bound on the time and space cost of exact inference from a current assignment and the remaining schematic. We show how our bounding method can be used within a lifted importance sampling algorithm, in order to perform effective Rao-Blackwellisation, and demonstrate experimentally that the Rao-Blackwellised version of the algorithm yields more accurate estimates on several real-world datasets.  
We propose Kernel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (KMC), a gradient-free adaptive MCMC algorithm based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). On target densities where classical HMC is not an option due to intractable gradients, KMC adaptively learns the target’s gradient structure by fitting an exponential family model in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Computational costs are reduced by two novel efficient approximations to this gradient. While being asymptotically exact, KMC mimics HMC in terms of sampling efficiency, and offers substantial mixing improvements over state-of-the-art gradient free samplers. We support our claims with experimental studies on both toy and real-world applications, including Approximate Bayesian Computation and exact-approximate MCMC.  
We study an idealised sequential resource allocation problem. In each time step the learner chooses an allocation of several resource types between a number of tasks. Assigning more resources to a task increases the probability that it is completed. The problem is challenging because the alignment of the tasks to the resource types is unknown and the feedback is noisy. Our main contribution is the new setting and an algorithm with nearly-optimal regret analysis. Along the way we draw connections to the problem of minimising regret for stochastic linear bandits with heteroscedastic noise. We also present some new results for stochastic linear bandits on the hypercube that significantly improve on existing work, especially in the sparse case.  
We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm that combines probabilistic modeling with solver-based techniques for program synthesis. We apply our techniques to both a visual learning domain and a language learning problem, showing that our algorithm can learn many visual concepts from only a few examples and that it can recover some English inflectional morphology. Taken together, these results give both a new approach to unsupervised learning of symbolic compositional structures, and a technique for applying program synthesis tools to noisy data.  
Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition has wide applications in statistical learning of latent variable models and in data mining. In this paper, we propose fast and randomized tensor CP decomposition algorithms based on sketching. We build on the idea of count sketches, but introduce many novel ideas which are unique to tensors. We develop novel methods for randomized computation of tensor contractions via FFTs, without explicitly forming the tensors. Such tensor contractions are encountered in decomposition methods such as tensor power iterations and alternating least squares. We also design novel colliding hashes for symmetric tensors to further save time in computing the sketches. We then combine these sketching ideas with existing whitening and tensor power iterative techniques to obtain the fastest algorithm on both sparse and dense tensors. The quality of approximation under our method does not depend on properties such as sparsity, uniformity of elements, etc. We apply the method for topic modeling and obtain competitive results.  
Subspace clustering is an unsupervised learning problem that aims at grouping data points into multiple “clusters” so that data points in a single cluster lie approximately on a low-dimensional linear subspace. It is originally motivated by 3D motion segmentation in computer vision, but has recently been generically applied to a wide range of statistical machine learning problems, which often involves sensitive datasets about human subjects. This raises a dire concern for data privacy. In this work, we build on the framework of differential privacy and present two provably private subspace clustering algorithms. We demonstrate via both theory and experiments that one of the presented methods enjoys formal privacy and utility guarantees; the other one asymptotically preserves differential privacy while having good performance in practice. Along the course of the proof, we also obtain two new provable guarantees for the agnostic subspace clustering and the graph connectivity problem which might be of independent interests.  
Modern prediction problems arising in multilabel learning and learning to rank pose unique challenges to the classical theory of supervised learning. These problems have large prediction and label spaces of a combinatorial nature and involve sophisticated loss functions. We offer a general framework to derive mistake driven online algorithms and associated loss bounds. The key ingredients in our framework are a general loss function, a general vector space representation of predictions, and a notion of margin with respect to a general norm. Our general algorithm, Predtron, yields the perceptron algorithm and its variants when instantiated on classic problems such as binary classification, multiclass classification, ordinal regression, and multilabel classification. For multilabel ranking and subset ranking, we derive novel algorithms, notions of margins, and loss bounds. A simulation study confirms the behavior predicted by our bounds and demonstrates the flexibility of the design choices in our framework.  
We introduce a unifying generalization of the Lovász theta function, and the associated geometric embedding, for graphs with weights on both nodes and edges. We show how it can be computed exactly by semidefinite programming, and how to approximate it using SVM computations. We show how the theta function can be interpreted as a measure of diversity in graphs and use this idea, and the graph embedding in algorithms for Max-Cut, correlation clustering and document summarization, all of which are well represented as problems on weighted graphs.  
In many learning problems, ranging from clustering to ranking through metric learning, empirical estimates of the risk functional consist of an average over tuples (e.g., pairs or triplets) of observations, rather than over individual observations. In this paper, we focus on how to best implement a stochastic approximation approach to solve such risk minimization problems. We argue that in the largescale setting, gradient estimates should be obtained by sampling tuples of data points with replacement (incomplete U -statistics) instead of sampling data points without replacement (complete U -statistics based on subsamples). We develop a theoretical framework accounting for the substantial impact of this strategy on the generalization ability of the prediction model returned by the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. It reveals that the method we promote achieves a much better trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational cost. Beyond the rate bound analysis, experiments on AUC maximization and metric learning provide strong empirical evidence of the superiority of the proposed approach.  
This paper discusses how to efficiently choose from n unknown distributions the k ones whose means are the greatest by a certain metric, up to a small relative error. We study the topic under two standard settings—multi-armed bandits and hidden bipartite graphs—which differ in the nature of the input distributions. In the former setting, each distribution can be sampled (in the i.i.d. manner) an arbitrary number of times, whereas in the latter, each distribution is defined on a population of a finite size m (and hence, is fully revealed after m samples). For both settings, we prove lower bounds on the total number of samples needed, and propose optimal algorithms whose sample complexities match those lower bounds.  
In simple perceptual decisions the brain has to identify a stimulus based on noisy sensory samples from the stimulus. Basic statistical considerations state that the reliability of the stimulus information, i.e., the amount of noise in the samples, should be taken into account when the decision is made. However, for perceptual decision making experiments it has been questioned whether the brain indeed uses the reliability for making decisions when confronted with unpredictable changes in stimulus reliability. We here show that even the basic drift diffusion model, which has frequently been used to explain experimental findings in perceptual decision making, implicitly relies on estimates of stimulus reliability. We then show that only those variants of the drift diffusion model which allow stimulusspecific reliabilities are consistent with neurophysiological findings. Our analysis suggests that the brain estimates the reliability of the stimulus on a short time scale of at most a few hundred milliseconds.  
We consider the problem of binary classification when the covariates conditioned on the each of the response values follow multivariate Gaussian distributions. We focus on the setting where the covariance matrices for the two conditional distributions are the same. The corresponding generative model classifier, derived via the Bayes rule, also called Linear Discriminant Analysis, has been shown to behave poorly in high-dimensional settings. We present a novel analysis of the classification error of any linear discriminant approach given conditional Gaussian models. This allows us to compare the generative model classifier, other recently proposed discriminative approaches that directly learn the discriminant function, and then finally logistic regression which is another classical discriminative model classifier. As we show, under a natural sparsity assumption, and letting s denote the sparsity of the Bayes classifier, p the number of covariates, and n the number of samples, the simple (`1 -regularized)  logistic  regression classifier achieves p the fast misclassification error rates of O s log , which is much better than the n other approaches, which are either under high-dimensional settings, q inconsistent  s log p or achieve a slower rate of O .n  
Clustering large data is a fundamental problem with a vast number of applications. Due to the increasing size of data, practitioners interested in clustering have turned to distributed computation methods. In this work, we consider the widely used kcenter clustering problem and its variant used to handle noisy data, k-center with outliers. In the noise-free setting we demonstrate how a previously-proposed distributed method is actually an O(1)-approximation algorithm, which accurately explains its strong empirical performance. Additionally, in the noisy setting, we develop a novel distributed algorithm that is also an O(1)-approximation. These algorithms are highly parallel and lend themselves to virtually any distributed computing framework. We compare each empirically against the best known sequential clustering methods and show that both distributed algorithms are consistently close to their sequential versions. The algorithms are all one can hope for in distributed settings: they are fast, memory efficient and they match their sequential counterparts.  
Imagine a random walk that outputs a state only when visiting it for the first time. The observed output is therefore a repeat-censored version of the underlying walk, and consists of a permutation of the states or a prefix of it. We call this model initial-visit emitting random walk (INVITE). Prior work has shown that the random walks with such a repeat-censoring mechanism explain well human behavior in memory search tasks, which is of great interest in both the study of human cognition and various clinical applications. However, parameter estimation in INVITE is challenging, because naive likelihood computation by marginalizing over infinitely many hidden random walk trajectories is intractable. In this paper, we propose the first efficient maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for INVITE by decomposing the censored output into a series of absorbing random walks. We also prove theoretical properties of the MLE including identifiability and consistency. We show that INVITE outperforms several existing methods on real-world human response data from memory search tasks.  
We consider the estimation of sparse graphical models that characterize the dependency structure of high-dimensional tensor-valued data. To facilitate the estimation of the precision matrix corresponding to each way of the tensor, we assume the data follow a tensor normal distribution whose covariance has a Kronecker product structure. The penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this model involves minimizing a non-convex objective function. In spite of the non-convexity of this estimation problem, we prove that an alternating minimization algorithm, which iteratively estimates each sparse precision matrix while fixing the others, attains an estimator with the optimal statistical rate of convergence as well as consistent graph recovery. Notably, such an estimator achieves estimation consistency with only one tensor sample, which is unobserved in previous work. Our theoretical results are backed by thorough numerical studies.  
An active learner is given a class of models, a large set of unlabeled examples, and the ability to interactively query labels of a subset of these examples; the goal of the learner is to learn a model in the class that fits the data well. Previous theoretical work has rigorously characterized label complexity of active learning, but most of this work has focused on the PAC or the agnostic PAC model. In this paper, we shift our attention to a more general setting – maximum likelihood estimation. Provided certain conditions hold on the model class, we provide a two-stage active learning algorithm for this problem. The conditions we require are fairly general, and cover the widely popular class of Generalized Linear Models, which in turn, include models for binary and multi-class classification, regression, and conditional random fields. We provide an upper bound on the label requirement of our algorithm, and a lower bound that matches it up to lower order terms. Our analysis shows that unlike binary classification in the realizable case, just a single extra round of interaction is sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance in maximum likelihood estimation. On the empirical side, the recent work in [12] and [13] (on active linear and logistic regression) shows the promise of this approach.  
An important problem for both graphics and vision is to synthesize novel views of a 3D object from a single image. This is particularly challenging due to the partial observability inherent in projecting a 3D object onto the image space, and the ill-posedness of inferring object shape and pose. However, we can train a neural network to address the problem if we restrict our attention to specific object categories (in our case faces and chairs) for which we can gather ample training data. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent convolutional encoder-decoder network that is trained end-to-end on the task of rendering rotated objects starting from a single image. The recurrent structure allows our model to capture long-term dependencies along a sequence of transformations. We demonstrate the quality of its predictions for human faces on the Multi-PIE dataset and for a dataset of 3D chair models, and also show its ability to disentangle latent factors of variation (e.g., identity and pose) without using full supervision.  
An important class of problems involves training deep neural networks with sparse prediction targets of very high dimension D. These occur naturally in e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200 000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does updating the D × d output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach which, for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in O(d2 ) per example instead of O(Dd), remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields D a speedup of 4d , i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for that critical part of the computations that often dominates the training time in this kind of network architecture.  
Solving real world problems with embedded neural networks requires both training algorithms that achieve high performance and compatible hardware that runs in real time while remaining energy efficient. For the former, deep learning using backpropagation has recently achieved a string of successes across many domains and datasets. For the latter, neuromorphic chips that run spiking neural networks have recently achieved unprecedented energy efficiency. To bring these two advances together, we must first resolve the incompatibility between backpropagation, which uses continuous-output neurons and synaptic weights, and neuromorphic designs, which employ spiking neurons and discrete synapses. Our approach is to treat spikes and discrete synapses as continuous probabilities, which allows training the network using standard backpropagation. The trained network naturally maps to neuromorphic hardware by sampling the probabilities to create one or more networks, which are merged using ensemble averaging. To demonstrate, we trained a sparsely connected network that runs on the TrueNorth chip using the MNIST dataset. With a high performance network (ensemble of 64), we achieve 99.42% accuracy at 108 µJ per image, and with a high efficiency network (ensemble of 1) we achieve 92.7% accuracy at 0.268 µJ per image.  
Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems. Also, conventional networks fix the architecture before training starts; as a result, training cannot improve the architecture. To address these limitations, we describe a method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections. Our method prunes redundant connections using a three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are important. Next, we prune the unimportant connections. Finally, we retrain the network to fine tune the weights of the remaining connections. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the number of parameters of AlexNet by a factor of 9×, from 61 million to 6.7 million, without incurring accuracy loss. Similar experiments with VGG-16 found that the total number of parameters can be reduced by 13×, from 138 million to 10.3 million, again with no loss of accuracy.  
Kernel methods represent one of the most powerful tools in machine learning to tackle problems expressed in terms of function values and derivatives due to their capability to represent and model complex relations. While these methods show good versatility, they are computationally intensive and have poor scalability to large data as they require operations on Gram matrices. In order to mitigate this serious computational limitation, recently randomized constructions have been proposed in the literature, which allow the application of fast linear algorithms. Random Fourier features (RFF) are among the most popular and widely applied constructions: they provide an easily computable, low-dimensional feature representation for shift-invariant kernels. Despite the popularity of RFFs, very little is understood theoretically about their approximation quality. In this paper, we provide a detailed finite-sample theoretical analysis about the approximation quality of RFFs by (i) establishing optimal (in terms of the RFF dimension, and growing set size) performance guarantees in uniform norm, and (ii) presenting guarantees in Lr (1 ≤ r < ∞) norms. We also propose an RFF approximation to derivatives of a kernel with a theoretical study on its approximation quality.  
Many modern data analysis problems involve inferences from streaming data. However, streaming data is not easily amenable to the standard probabilistic modeling approaches, which require conditioning on finite data. We develop population variational Bayes, a new approach for using Bayesian modeling to analyze streams of data. It approximates a new type of distribution, the population posterior, which combines the notion of a population distribution of the data with Bayesian inference in a probabilistic model. We develop the population posterior for latent Dirichlet allocation and Dirichlet process mixtures. We study our method with several large-scale data sets.  
There is renewed interest in formulating integration as a statistical inference problem, motivated by obtaining a full distribution over numerical error that can be propagated through subsequent computation. Current methods, such as Bayesian Quadrature, demonstrate impressive empirical performance but lack theoretical analysis. An important challenge is therefore to reconcile these probabilistic integrators with rigorous convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present the first probabilistic integrator that admits such theoretical treatment, called Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature (FWBQ). Under FWBQ, convergence to the true value of the integral is shown to be up to exponential and posterior contraction rates are proven to be up to super-exponential. In simulations, FWBQ is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and out-performs alternatives based on Frank-Wolfe optimisation. Our approach is applied to successfully quantify numerical error in the solution to a challenging Bayesian model choice problem in cellular biology.  
Recurrent Neural Networks can be trained to produce sequences of tokens given some input, as exemplified by recent results in machine translation and image captioning. The current approach to training them consists of maximizing the likelihood of each token in the sequence given the current (recurrent) state and the previous token. At inference, the unknown previous token is then replaced by a token generated by the model itself. This discrepancy between training and inference can yield errors that can accumulate quickly along the generated sequence. We propose a curriculum learning strategy to gently change the training process from a fully guided scheme using the true previous token, towards a less guided scheme which mostly uses the generated token instead. Experiments on several sequence prediction tasks show that this approach yields significant improvements. Moreover, it was used succesfully in our winning entry to the MSCOCO image captioning challenge, 2015.  
In this paper, we present a unified analysis of matrix completion under general low-dimensional structural constraints induced by any norm regularization. We consider two estimators for the general problem of structured matrix completion, and provide unified upper bounds on the sample complexity and the estimation error. Our analysis relies on results from generic chaining, and we establish two intermediate results of independent interest: (a) in characterizing the size or complexity of low dimensional subsets in high dimensional ambient space, a certain partial complexity measure encountered in the analysis of matrix completion problems is characterized in terms of a well understood complexity measure of Gaussian widths, and (b) it is shown that a form of restricted strong convexity holds for matrix completion problems under general norm regularization. Further, we provide several non-trivial examples of structures included in our framework, notably the recently proposed spectral k-support norm.  
The paradigm of multi-task learning is that one can achieve better generalization by learning tasks jointly and thus exploiting the similarity between the tasks rather than learning them independently of each other. While previously the relationship between tasks had to be user-defined in the form of an output kernel, recent approaches jointly learn the tasks and the output kernel. As the output kernel is a positive semidefinite matrix, the resulting optimization problems are not scalable in the number of tasks as an eigendecomposition is required in each step. Using the theory of positive semidefinite kernels we show in this paper that for a certain class of regularizers on the output kernel, the constraint of being positive semidefinite can be dropped as it is automatically satisfied for the relaxed problem. This leads to an unconstrained dual problem which can be solved efficiently. Experiments on several multi-task and multi-class data sets illustrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational efficiency as well as generalization performance.  
Bayesian nonparametric hidden Markov models are typically learned via fixed truncations of the infinite state space or local Monte Carlo proposals that make small changes to the state space. We develop an inference algorithm for the sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model that scales to big datasets by processing a few sequences at a time yet allows rapid adaptation of the state space cardinality. Unlike previous point-estimate methods, our novel variational bound penalizes redundant or irrelevant states and thus enables optimization of the state space. Our birth proposals use observed data statistics to create useful new states that escape local optima. Merge and delete proposals remove ineffective states to yield simpler models with more affordable future computations. Experiments on speaker diarization, motion capture, and epigenetic chromatin datasets discover models that are more compact, more interpretable, and better aligned to ground truth segmentations than competitors. We have released an open-source Python implementation which can parallelize local inference steps across sequences.  
Practitioners of Bayesian statistics have long depended on Markov chain Monte  Carlo (MCMC) to obtain samples from intractable posterior distributions. Unfortunately, MCMC algorithms are typically serial, and do not scale to the large  datasets typical of modern machine learning. The recently proposed consensus  Monte Carlo algorithm removes this limitation by partitioning the data and drawing samples conditional on each partition in parallel [22]. A fixed aggregation  function then combines these samples, yielding approximate posterior samples.  We introduce variational consensus Monte Carlo (VCMC), a variational Bayes  algorithm that optimizes over aggrgegation functions to obtain samples from a distribution that better approximates the target. The resulting objective contains an  intractable entropy term; we therefore derive a relaxation of the objective and  show that the relaxed problem is blockwise concave under mild conditions. We  illustrate the advantages of our algorithm on three inference tasks from the literature, demonstrating both the superior quality of the posterior approximation  and the moderate overhead of the optimization step. Our algorithm achieves a  relative error reduction (measured against serial MCMC) of up to 39% compared  to consensus Monte Carlo on the task of estimating 300-dimensional probit regression parameter expectations; similarly, it achieves an error reduction of 92%  on the task of estimating cluster comembership probabilities in a Gaussian mixture model with 8 components in 8 dimensions. Furthermore, these gains come  at moderate cost compared to the runtime of serial MCMC—achieving near-ideal  speedup in some instances.  
We consider the problem of efficiently computing the maximum likelihood estimator in Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) when the number of observations  is much larger than the number of coefficients (n p 1). In this regime, optimization algorithms can immensely benefit from approximate second order information. We propose an alternative way of constructing the curvature information by formulating it as an estimation problem and applying a Stein-type lemma,  which allows further improvements through sub-sampling and eigenvalue thresholding. Our algorithm enjoys fast convergence rates, resembling that of second  order methods, with modest per-iteration cost. We provide its convergence analysis for the case where the rows of the design matrix are i.i.d. samples with bounded  support. We show that the convergence has two phases, a quadratic phase followed  by a linear phase. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm achieves  the highest performance compared to various algorithms on several datasets.  
We show the existence of a Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) family for the angular distance that yields an approximate Near Neighbor Search algorithm with the  asymptotically optimal running time exponent. Unlike earlier algorithms with this  property (e.g., Spherical LSH [1, 2]), our algorithm is also practical, improving  upon the well-studied hyperplane LSH [3] in practice. We also introduce a multiprobe version of this algorithm and conduct an experimental evaluation on real  and synthetic data sets.  We complement the above positive results with a fine-grained lower bound for the  quality of any LSH family for angular distance. Our lower bound implies that the  above LSH family exhibits a trade-off between evaluation time and quality that is  close to optimal for a natural class of LSH functions.  
Training deep feature hierarchies to solve supervised learning tasks has achieved  state of the art performance on many problems in computer vision. However, a  principled way in which to train such hierarchies in the unsupervised setting has  remained elusive. In this work we suggest a new architecture and loss for training  deep feature hierarchies that linearize the transformations observed in unlabeled  natural video sequences. This is done by training a generative model to predict  video frames. We also address the problem of inherent uncertainty in prediction  by introducing latent variables that are non-deterministic functions of the input  into the network architecture.  
We analyze the projected Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm, a close cousin  of projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We show that LMC allows to  sample in polynomial time from a posterior distribution restricted to a convex  body and with concave log-likelihood. This gives the first Markov chain to sample  from a log-concave distribution with a first-order oracle, as the existing chains  with provable guarantees (lattice walk, ball walk and hit-and-run) require a zerothorder oracle. Our proof uses elementary concepts from stochastic calculus which  could be useful more generally to understand SGD and its variants.  
In addition to identifying the content within a single image, relating images and  generating related images are critical tasks for image understanding. Recently,  deep convolutional networks have yielded breakthroughs in predicting image labels, annotations and captions, but have only just begun to be used for generating high-quality images. In this paper we develop a novel deep network trained  end-to-end to perform visual analogy making, which is the task of transforming a  query image according to an example pair of related images. Solving this problem  requires both accurately recognizing a visual relationship and generating a transformed query image accordingly. Inspired by recent advances in language modeling, we propose to solve visual analogies by learning to map images to a neural  embedding in which analogical reasoning is simple, such as by vector subtraction  and addition. In experiments, our model effectively models visual analogies on  several datasets: 2D shapes, animated video game sprites, and 3D car models.  
The completion of low rank matrices from few entries is a task with many practical  applications. We consider here two aspects of this problem: detectability, i.e. the  ability to estimate the rank r reliably from the fewest possible random entries,  and performance in achieving small reconstruction error. We propose a spectral  algorithm for these two tasks called MaCBetH (for Matrix Completion with the  Bethe Hessian). The rank is estimated as the number of negative eigenvalues of  the Bethe Hessian matrix, and the corresponding eigenvectors are used as initial  condition for the minimization of the discrepancy between the estimated matrix  and the revealed entries. We analyze the performance in a random matrix setting  using results from the statistical mechanics of the Hopfield neural network, and  show in particular that√MaCBetH efficiently detects the rank r of a large n ×  m matrix from C(r)r nm entries, where C(r) is a constant close to 1. We  also evaluate the corresponding root-mean-square error empirically and show that  MaCBetH compares favorably to other existing approaches.  
Matrix completion is the task of inferring the missing entries of a matrix given a subset of known  entries. Typically, this is possible because the matrix to be completed has (at least approximately)  low rank r. This problem has witnessed a burst of activity, see e.g. [1, 2, 3], motivated by many  applications such as collaborative filtering [1], quantum tomography [4] in physics, or the analysis  of a covariance matrix [1]. A commonly studied model for matrix completion assumes the matrix  to be exactly low rank, with the known entries chosen uniformly at random and observed without  noise. The most widely considered question in this setting is how many entries need to be revealed  such that the matrix can be completed exactly in a computationally efficient way [1, 3]. While our  present paper assumes the same model, the main questions we investigate are different.  The first question we address is detectability: how many random entries do we need to reveal in order  to be able to estimate the rank r reliably. This is motivated by the more generic problem of detecting  structure (in our case, low rank) hidden in partially observed data. It is reasonable to expect the  existence of a region where exact completion is hard or even impossible yet the rank estimation is  tractable. A second question we address is what is the minimum achievable root-mean-square error  (RMSE) in estimating the unknown elements of the matrix. In practice, even if exact reconstruction  is not possible, having a procedure that provides a very small RMSE might be quite sufficient.  
In this paper we propose an algorithm called MaCBetH that gives the best known empirical performance for the two tasks above when the rank r is small. The rank in our algorithm is estimated as the  number of negative eigenvalues of an associated Bethe Hessian matrix [5, 6], and the corresponding  eigenvectors are used as an initial condition for the local optimization of a cost function commonly  considered in matrix completion (see e.g. [3]). In particular, in the random matrix setting, we show  
 We study the performance of standard online learning algorithms when the feedback is delayed by an adversary. We show that online-gradient-descent  √  [1] and follow-the-perturbed-leader [2] achieve regret O( D) in the  delayed setting, where D is the sum  √ of delays of each round’s feedback. This  bound collapses to an optimal O( T ) bound in the usual setting of no delays  (where D = T ). Our main contribution is to show that standard algorithms for  online learning already have simple regret bounds in the most general setting of  delayed feedback, making adjustments to the analysis and not to the algorithms  themselves. Our results help affirm and clarify the success of recent algorithms in  optimization and machine learning that operate in a delayed feedback model.  
Tree structured group Lasso (TGL) is a powerful technique in uncovering the tree  structured sparsity over the features, where each node encodes a group of features.  It has been applied successfully in many real-world applications. However, with  extremely large feature dimensions, solving TGL remains a significant challenge  due to its highly complicated regularizer. In this paper, we propose a novel MultiLayer Feature reduction method (MLFre) to quickly identify the inactive nodes  (the groups of features with zero coefficients in the solution) hierarchically in a  top-down fashion, which are guaranteed to be irrelevant to the response. Thus, we  can remove the detected nodes from the optimization without sacrificing accuracy. The major challenge in developing such testing rules is due to the overlaps  between the parents and their children nodes. By a novel hierarchical projection algorithm, MLFre is able to test the nodes independently from any of their  ancestor nodes. Moreover, we can integrate MLFre—that has a low computational cost—with any existing solvers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data  sets demonstrate that the speedup gained by MLFre can be orders of magnitude.  
Max-product Belief Propagation (BP) is a popular message-passing algorithm for  computing a Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) assignment over a distribution represented by a Graphical Model (GM). It has been shown that BP can solve a number of combinatorial optimization problems including minimum weight matching,  shortest path, network flow and vertex cover under the following common assumption: the respective Linear Programming (LP) relaxation is tight, i.e., no integrality  gap is present. However, when LP shows an integrality gap, no model has been  known which can be solved systematically via sequential applications of BP. In  this paper, we develop the first such algorithm, coined Blossom-BP, for solving  the minimum weight matching problem over arbitrary graphs. Each step of the  sequential algorithm requires applying BP over a modified graph constructed by  contractions and expansions of blossoms, i.e., odd sets of vertices. Our scheme  guarantees termination in O(n2 ) of BP runs, where n is the number of vertices in  the original graph. In essence, the Blossom-BP offers a distributed version of the  celebrated Edmonds’ Blossom algorithm by jumping at once over many sub-steps  with a single BP. Moreover, our result provides an interpretation of the Edmonds’  algorithm as a sequence of LPs.  
Matrix factorization (MF) collaborative filtering is an effective and widely used  method in recommendation systems. However, the problem of finding an optimal  trade-off between exploration and exploitation (otherwise known as the bandit  problem), a crucial problem in collaborative filtering from cold-start, has not been  previously addressed. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for online MF  recommendation that automatically combines finding the most relevant items with  exploring new or less-recommended items. Our approach, called Particle Thompson sampling for MF (PTS), is based on the general Thompson sampling framework, but augmented with a novel efficient online Bayesian probabilistic matrix  factorization method based on the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. Extensive experiments in collaborative filtering using several real-world datasets demonstrate  that PTS significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-arts.  
The iteration complexity of the block-coordinate descent (BCD) type algorithm  has been under extensive investigation. It was recently shown that for convex  problems the classical cyclic BCGD (block coordinate gradient descent) achieves  an O(1/r) complexity (r is the number of passes of all blocks). However, such  bounds are at least linearly depend on K (the number of variable blocks), and  are at least K times worse than those of the gradient descent (GD) and proximal  gradient (PG) methods. In this paper, we close such theoretical performance gap  between cyclic BCD and GD/PG. First we show that for a family of quadratic  nonsmooth problems, the complexity bounds for cyclic Block Coordinate Proximal Gradient (BCPG), a popular variant of BCD, can match those of the GD/PG  in terms of dependency on K (up to a log2 (K) factor). Second, we establish an  improved complexity bound for Coordinate Gradient Descent (CGD) for general  convex problems which can match that of GD in certain scenarios. Our bounds  are sharper than the known bounds as they are always at least K times worse than  GD. Our analyses do not depend on the update order of block variables inside  each cycle, thus our results also apply to BCD methods with random permutation  (random sampling without replacement, another popular variant).  
Symmetry breaking is a technique for speeding up propositional satisfiability testing by adding constraints to the theory that restrict the search space while preserving satisfiability. In this work, we extend symmetry breaking to the problem of  model finding in weighted and unweighted relational theories, a class of problems  that includes MAP inference in Markov Logic and similar statistical-relational  languages. We introduce term symmetries, which are induced by an evidence  set and extend to symmetries over a relational theory. We provide the important  special case of term equivalent symmetries, showing that such symmetries can  be found in low-degree polynomial time. We show how to break an exponential  number of these symmetries with added constraints whose number is linear in the  size of the domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques through  experiments in two relational domains. We also discuss the connections between  relational symmetry breaking and work on lifted inference in statistical-relational  reasoning.  
Biclustering (also known as submatrix localization) is a problem of high practical relevance in exploratory analysis of high-dimensional data. We develop a  framework for performing statistical inference on biclusters found by score-based  algorithms. Since the bicluster was selected in a data dependent manner by a  biclustering or localization algorithm, this is a form of selective inference. Our  framework gives exact (non-asymptotic) confidence intervals and p-values for the  significance of the selected biclusters.  
This paper proposes a framework for learning features that are robust to data variation, which is particularly important when only a limited number of training  samples are available. The framework makes it possible to tradeoff the discriminative value of learned features against the generalization error of the learning  algorithm. Robustness is achieved by encouraging the transform that maps data  to features to be a local isometry. This geometric property is shown to improve  (K, )-robustness, thereby providing theoretical justification for reductions in generalization error observed in experiments. The proposed optimization framework  is used to train standard learning algorithms such as deep neural networks. Experimental results obtained on benchmark datasets, such as labeled faces in the wild,  demonstrate the value of being able to balance discrimination and robustness.  
The Multi-Armed Bandit problem constitutes an archetypal setting for sequential  decision-making, permeating multiple domains including engineering, business,  and medicine. One of the hallmarks of a bandit setting is the agent’s capacity  to explore its environment through active intervention, which contrasts with the  ability to collect passive data by estimating associational relationships between  actions and payouts. The existence of unobserved confounders, namely unmeasured variables affecting both the action and the outcome variables, implies that  these two data-collection modes will in general not coincide. In this paper, we  show that formalizing this distinction has conceptual and algorithmic implications  to the bandit setting. The current generation of bandit algorithms implicitly try to  maximize rewards based on estimation of the experimental distribution, which  we show is not always the best strategy to pursue. Indeed, to achieve low regret  in certain realistic classes of bandit problems (namely, in the face of unobserved  confounders), both experimental and observational quantities are required by the  rational agent. After this realization, we propose an optimization metric (employing both experimental and observational distributions) that bandit agents should  pursue, and illustrate its benefits over traditional algorithms.  
We present and empirically evaluate an efficient algorithm that learns to aggregate the predictions of an ensemble of binary classifiers. The algorithm uses the  structure of the ensemble predictions on unlabeled data to yield significant performance improvements. It does this without making assumptions on the structure or  origin of the ensemble, without parameters, and as scalably as linear learning. We  empirically demonstrate these performance gains with random forests.  
We consider a sequential learning problem with Gaussian payoffs and side observations: after selecting an action i, the learner receives information about the  payoff of every action j in the form of Gaussian observations whose mean is the  same as the mean payoff, but the variance depends on the pair (i, j) (and may be  infinite). The setup allows a more refined information transfer from one action to  another than previous partial monitoring setups, including the recently introduced  graph-structured feedback case. For the first time in the literature, we provide  non-asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds on the regret of any algorithm,  which recover existing asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds and finitetime minimax lower bounds available in the literature. We also provide algorithms  that achieve the problem-dependent lower bound (up to some universal constant  factor) or the minimax lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors).  
We design algorithms for fitting a high-dimensional statistical model to a large,  sparse network without revealing sensitive information of individual members.  Given a sparse input graph G, our algorithms output a node-differentially private  nonparametric block model approximation. By node-differentially private, we  mean that our output hides the insertion or removal of a vertex and all its adjacent  edges. If G is an instance of the network obtained from a generative nonparametric  model defined in terms of a graphon W , our model guarantees consistency: as the  number of vertices tends to infinity, the output of our algorithm converges to W in  an appropriate version of the L2 norm. In particular, this means we can estimate  the sizes of all multi-way cuts in G.  Our results hold as long as W is bounded, the average degree of G grows at least  like the log of the number of vertices, and the number of blocks goes to infinity  at an appropriate rate. We give explicit error bounds in terms of the parameters of  the model; in several settings, our bounds improve on or match known nonprivate  results.  
This paper formulates the search for a set of bounding boxes (as needed in object  proposal generation) as a monotone submodular maximization problem over the  space of all possible bounding boxes in an image. Since the number of possible  bounding boxes in an image is very large O(#pixels2 ), even a single linear scan  to perform the greedy augmentation for submodular maximization is intractable.  Thus, we formulate the greedy augmentation step as a Branch-and-Bound scheme.  In order to speed up repeated application of B&B, we propose a novel generalization of Minoux’s ‘lazy greedy’ algorithm to the B&B tree. Theoretically, our  proposed formulation provides a new understanding to the problem, and contains  classic heuristic approaches such as Sliding Window+Non-Maximal Suppression  (NMS) and and Efficient Subwindow Search (ESS) as special cases. Empirically,  we show that our approach leads to a state-of-art performance on object proposal  generation via a novel diversity measure.  
 We propose a second-order (Hessian or Hessian-free) based optimization method  for variational inference inspired by Gaussian backpropagation, and argue that  quasi-Newton optimization can be developed as well. This is accomplished  by generalizing the gradient computation in stochastic backpropagation via a  reparametrization trick with lower complexity. As an illustrative example, we apply this approach to the problems of Bayesian logistic regression and variational  auto-encoder (VAE). Additionally, we compute bounds on the estimator variance  of intractable expectations for the family of Lipschitz continuous function. Our  method is practical, scalable and model free. We demonstrate our method on several real-world datasets and provide comparisons with other stochastic gradient  methods to show substantial enhancement in convergence rates.  
Since being analyzed by Rokhlin, Szlam, and Tygert [1] and popularized by  Halko, Martinsson, and Tropp [2], randomized Simultaneous Power Iteration has  become the method of choice for approximate singular value decomposition. It is  more accurate than simpler sketching algorithms, yet still converges quickly for  any matrix, independently of singular value gaps. After Õ(1/) iterations, it gives  a low-rank approximation within (1 + ) of optimal for spectral norm error.  We give the first provable runtime improvement on Simultaneous Iteration: a randomized block Krylov method, closely related to the classic Block Lanczos algo√  rithm, gives the same guarantees in just Õ(1/ ) iterations and performs substantially better experimentally. Our analysis is the first of a Krylov subspace method  that does not depend on singular value gaps, which are unreliable in practice.  Furthermore, while it is a simple accuracy benchmark, even (1 + ) error for  spectral norm low-rank approximation does not imply that an algorithm returns  high quality principal components, a major issue for data applications. We address  this problem for the first time by showing that both Block Krylov Iteration and  Simultaneous Iteration give nearly optimal PCA for any matrix. This result further  justifies their strength over non-iterative sketching methods.  
We propose a kernel-based method for finding matching between instances across  different domains, such as multilingual documents and images with annotations.  Each instance is assumed to be represented as a multiset of features, e.g., a bag-ofwords representation for documents. The major difficulty in finding cross-domain  relationships is that the similarity between instances in different domains cannot  be directly measured. To overcome this difficulty, the proposed method embeds  all the features of different domains in a shared latent space, and regards each  instance as a distribution of its own features in the shared latent space. To represent the distributions efficiently and nonparametrically, we employ the framework  of the kernel embeddings of distributions. The embedding is estimated so as to  minimize the difference between distributions of paired instances while keeping  unpaired instances apart. In our experiments, we show that the proposed method  can achieve high performance on finding correspondence between multi-lingual  Wikipedia articles, between documents and tags, and between images and tags.  
We propose a sparse method for scalable automated variational inference (AVI) in  a large class of models with Gaussian process (GP) priors, multiple latent functions, multiple outputs and non-linear likelihoods. Our approach maintains the  statistical efficiency property of the original AVI method, requiring only expectations over univariate Gaussian distributions to approximate the posterior with a  mixture of Gaussians. Experiments on small datasets for various problems including regression, classification, Log Gaussian Cox processes, and warped GPs show  that our method can perform as well as the full method under high sparsity levels.  On larger experiments using the MNIST and the SARCOS datasets we show that  our method can provide superior performance to previously published scalable  approaches that have been handcrafted to specific likelihood models.  
We develop a new bidirectional algorithm for estimating Markov chain multi-step  transition probabilities: given a Markov chain, we want to estimate the probability of hitting a given target state in ` steps after starting from a given source  distribution. Given the target state t, we use a (reverse) local power iteration to  construct an ‘expanded target distribution’, which has the same mean as the quantity we want to estimate, but a smaller variance – this can then be sampled efficiently by a Monte Carlo algorithm. Our method extends to any Markov chain on  a discrete (finite or countable) state-space, and can be extended to compute functions of multi-step transition probabilities such as PageRank, graph diffusions, hitting/return times, etc. Our main result is that in ‘sparse’ Markov Chains – wherein  the number of transitions between states is comparable to the number of states –  the running time of our algorithm for a uniform-random target node is order-wise  smaller than Monte Carlo and power iteration based algorithms;  in particular, our  √  method can estimate a probability p using only O(1/ p) running time.  
Variational algorithms such as tree-reweighted belief propagation can provide deterministic bounds on the partition function, but are often loose and difficult to use  in an “any-time” fashion, expending more computation for tighter bounds. On the  other hand, Monte Carlo estimators such as importance sampling have excellent  any-time behavior, but depend critically on the proposal distribution. We propose  a simple Monte Carlo based inference method that augments convex variational  bounds by adding importance sampling (IS). We argue that convex variational  methods naturally provide good IS proposals that “cover” the target probability,  and reinterpret the variational optimization as designing a proposal to minimize an  upper bound on the variance of our IS estimator. This both provides an accurate  estimator and enables construction of any-time probabilistic bounds that improve  quickly and directly on state-of-the-art variational bounds, and provide certificates  of accuracy given enough samples relative to the error in the initial bound.  
Mean ﬁeld variational Bayes (MFVB) is a popular posterior approximation  method due to its fast runtime on large-scale data sets. However, a well known major failing of MFVB is that it underestimates the uncertainty of model variables  (sometimes severely) and provides no information about model variable covariance. We generalize linear response methods from statistical physics to deliver  accurate uncertainty estimates for model variables—both for individual variables  and coherently across variables. We call our method linear response variational  Bayes (LRVB). When the MFVB posterior approximation is in the exponential  family, LRVB has a simple, analytic form, even for non-conjugate models. Indeed, we make no assumptions about the form of the true posterior. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method on a range of models for both  simulated and real data.  
We propose combinatorial cascading bandits, a class of partial monitoring problems where at each step a learning agent chooses a tuple of ground items subject  to constraints and receives a reward if and only if the weights of all chosen items  are one. The weights of the items are binary, stochastic, and drawn independently  of each other. The agent observes the index of the first chosen item whose weight  is zero. This observation model arises in network routing, for instance, where the  learning agent may only observe the first link in the routing path which is down,  and blocks the path. We propose a UCB-like algorithm for solving our problems,  CombCascade; and prove gap-dependent and gap-free upper bounds on its n-step  regret. Our proofs build on recent work in stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits  but also address two novel challenges of our setting, a non-linear reward function  and partial observability. We evaluate CombCascade on two real-world problems  and show that it performs well even when our modeling assumptions are violated.  We also demonstrate that our setting requires a new learning algorithm.  
This article provides the first procedure for computing a fully data-dependent interval that traps the mixing time tmix of a finite reversible ergodic Markov chain at  a prescribed confidence level. The interval is computed from a single finite-length  sample path from the Markov chain, and does not require the knowledge of any  parameters of the chain. This stands in contrast to previous approaches, which either only provide point estimates, or require a reset mechanism, or additional prior  knowledge. The interval is constructed around the relaxation time trelax , which is  strongly related  √ to the mixing time, and the width of the interval converges to zero  roughly at a n rate, where n is the length of the sample path. Upper and lower  bounds are given on the number of samples required to achieve constant-factor  multiplicative accuracy. The lower bounds indicate that, unless further restrictions are placed on the chain, no procedure can achieve this accuracy level before  seeing each state at least Ω(trelax ) times on the average. Finally, future directions  of research are identified.  
Several authors have recently developed risk-sensitive policy gradient methods  that augment the standard expected cost minimization problem with a measure of  variability in cost. These studies have focused on specific risk-measures, such as  the variance or conditional value at risk (CVaR). In this work, we extend the policy gradient method to the whole class of coherent risk measures, which is widely  accepted in finance and operations research, among other fields. We consider  both static and time-consistent dynamic risk measures. For static risk measures,  our approach is in the spirit of policy gradient algorithms and combines a standard  sampling approach with convex programming. For dynamic risk measures, our approach is actor-critic style and involves explicit approximation of value function.  Most importantly, our contribution presents a unified approach to risk-sensitive reinforcement learning that generalizes and extends previous results.  
We consider Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) in the context of stochastic optimization with exp-concave and smooth losses—a general optimization framework that captures several important learning problems including linear and logistic regression, learning SVMs with the squared hinge-loss, portfolio selection  and more. In this setting, we establish the first evidence that ERM is able to attain fast generalization rates, and show that the expected loss of the ERM solution  in d dimensions converges to the optimal expected loss in a rate of d/n. This  rate matches existing lower bounds up to constants and improves by a log n factor  upon the state-of-the-art, which is only known to be attained by an online-to-batch  conversion of computationally expensive online algorithms.  
In this paper we introduce a generative parametric model capable of producing  high quality samples of natural images. Our approach uses a cascade of convolutional networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in  a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of the pyramid, a separate generative convnet model is trained using the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) approach [11].  Samples drawn from our model are of significantly higher quality than alternate  approaches. In a quantitative assessment by human evaluators, our CIFAR10 samples were mistaken for real images around 40% of the time, compared to 10% for  samples drawn from a GAN baseline model. We also show samples from models  trained on the higher resolution images of the LSUN scene dataset.  
We propose a novel deep neural network architecture for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using heterogeneous annotations. Contrary to existing approaches posing semantic segmentation as a single task of region-based classification, our algorithm decouples classification and segmentation, and learns a separate network for each task. In this architecture, labels associated with an image  are identified by classification network, and binary segmentation is subsequently  performed for each identified label in segmentation network. The decoupled architecture enables us to learn classification and segmentation networks separately  based on the training data with image-level and pixel-wise class labels, respectively. It facilitates to reduce search space for segmentation effectively by exploiting class-specific activation maps obtained from bridging layers. Our algorithm  shows outstanding performance compared to other semi-supervised approaches  with much less training images with strong annotations in PASCAL VOC dataset.    
Parameter-specific adaptive learning rate methods are computationally efficient  ways to reduce the ill-conditioning problems encountered when training large  deep networks. Following recent work that strongly suggests that most of the  critical points encountered when training such networks are saddle points, we find  how considering the presence of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian could help  us design better suited adaptive learning rate schemes. We show that the popular  Jacobi preconditioner has undesirable behavior in the presence of both positive  and negative curvature, and present theoretical and empirical evidence that the socalled equilibration preconditioner is comparatively better suited to non-convex  problems. We introduce a novel adaptive learning rate scheme, called ESGD,  based on the equilibration preconditioner. Our experiments show that ESGD performs as well or better than RMSProp in terms of convergence speed, always  clearly improving over plain stochastic gradient descent.  
We propose a simple method to learn linear causal cyclic models in the presence  of latent variables. The method relies on equilibrium data of the model recorded  under a specific kind of interventions (“shift interventions”). The location and  strength of these interventions do not have to be known and can be estimated from  the data. Our method, called BACK S HIFT, only uses second moments of the data  and performs simple joint matrix diagonalization, applied to differences between  covariance matrices. We give a sufficient and necessary condition for identifiability of the system, which is fulfilled almost surely under some quite general  assumptions if and only if there are at least three distinct experimental settings,  one of which can be pure observational data. We demonstrate the performance on  some simulated data and applications in flow cytometry and financial time series.  
In this paper we address the problem of decision making within a Markov decision process (MDP) framework where risk and modeling errors are taken into  account. Our approach is to minimize a risk-sensitive conditional-value-at-risk  (CVaR) objective, as opposed to a standard risk-neutral expectation. We refer to  such problem as CVaR MDP. Our first contribution is to show that a CVaR objective, besides capturing risk sensitivity, has an alternative interpretation as expected  cost under worst-case modeling errors, for a given error budget. This result, which  is of independent interest, motivates CVaR MDPs as a unifying framework for  risk-sensitive and robust decision making. Our second contribution is to present  an approximate value-iteration algorithm for CVaR MDPs and analyze its convergence rate. To our knowledge, this is the first solution algorithm for CVaR MDPs  that enjoys error guarantees. Finally, we present results from numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings and show the practicality of our  approach.  
We show that asymptotically, completely asynchronous stochastic gradient procedures achieve optimal (even to constant factors) convergence rates for the solution  of convex optimization problems under nearly the same conditions required for  asymptotic optimality of standard stochastic gradient procedures. Roughly, the  noise inherent to the stochastic approximation scheme dominates any noise from  asynchrony. We also give empirical evidence demonstrating the strong performance of asynchronous, parallel stochastic optimization schemes, demonstrating  that the robustness inherent to stochastic approximation problems allows substantially faster parallel and asynchronous solution methods. In short, we show that  for many stochastic approximation problems, as Freddie Mercury sings in Queen’s  Bohemian Rhapsody, “Nothing really matters.”  
In this work we aim at extending the theoretical foundations of lifelong learning.  Previous work analyzing this scenario is based on the assumption that learning  tasks are sampled i.i.d. from a task environment or limited to strongly constrained  data distributions. Instead, we study two scenarios when lifelong learning is possible, even though the observed tasks do not form an i.i.d. sample: first, when they  are sampled from the same environment, but possibly with dependencies, and second, when the task environment is allowed to change over time in a consistent  way. In the first case we prove a PAC-Bayesian theorem that can be seen as a  direct generalization of the analogous previous result for the i.i.d. case. For the  second scenario we propose to learn an inductive bias in form of a transfer procedure. We present a generalization bound and show on a toy example how it can be  used to identify a beneficial transfer algorithm.  
Linear regression studies the problem of estimating a model parameter β ∗ ∈ Rp ,  from n observations {(yi , xi )}ni=1 from linear model yi = hxi , β ∗ i + i . We  consider a significant generalization in which the relationship between hxi , β ∗ i  and yi is noisy, quantized to a single bit, potentially nonlinear, noninvertible, as  well as unknown. This model is known as the single-index model in statistics, and,  among other things, it represents a significant generalization of one-bit compressed  sensing. We propose a novel spectral-based estimation procedure and show that  we can recover β ∗ in settings (i.e., classes of link function f ) where previous  algorithms fail. In general, our algorithm requires only very mild restrictions on the  (unknown) functional relationship between yi and hxi , β ∗ i. We also consider the  high dimensional setting where β ∗ is sparse, and introduce a two-stage nonconvex  framework that addresses estimation challenges in high dimensional regimes where  p  n. For a broad class of link functions between hxi , β ∗ i and yi , we establish  minimax lower bounds that demonstrate the optimality of our estimators in both  the classical and high dimensional regimes.  
We analyze in this paper a random feature map based on a theory of invariance  (I-theory) introduced in [1]. More specifically, a group invariant signal signature  is obtained through cumulative distributions of group-transformed random projections. Our analysis bridges invariant feature learning with kernel methods, as  we show that this feature map defines an expected Haar-integration kernel that is  invariant to the specified group action. We show how this non-linear random feature map approximates this group invariant kernel uniformly on a set of N points.  Moreover, we show that it defines a function space that is dense in the equivalent  Invariant Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Finally, we quantify error rates of  the convergence of the empirical risk minimization, as well as the reduction in the  sample complexity of a learning algorithm using such an invariant representation  for signal classification, in a classical supervised learning setting.  
Latent models are a fundamental modeling tool in machine learning applications,  but they present significant computational and analytical challenges. The popular  EM algorithm and its variants, is a much used algorithmic tool; yet our rigorous  understanding of its performance is highly incomplete. Recently, work in [1] has  demonstrated that for an important class of problems, EM exhibits linear local  convergence. In the high-dimensional setting, however, the M -step may not be  well defined. We address precisely this setting through a unified treatment using  regularization. While regularization for high-dimensional problems is by now  well understood, the iterative EM algorithm requires a careful balancing of making  progress towards the solution while identifying the right structure (e.g., sparsity or  low-rank). In particular, regularizing the M -step using the state-of-the-art highdimensional prescriptions (e.g., à la [19]) is not guaranteed to provide this balance.  Our algorithm and analysis are linked in a way that reveals the balance between  optimization and statistical errors. We specialize our general framework to sparse  gaussian mixture models, high-dimensional mixed regression, and regression with  missing variables, obtaining statistical guarantees for each of these examples.  
Adaptive stochastic optimization (ASO) optimizes an objective function adaptively under uncertainty. It plays a crucial role in planning and learning under  uncertainty, but is, unfortunately, computationally intractable in general. This paper introduces two conditions on the objective function, the marginal likelihood  rate bound and the marginal likelihood bound, which, together with pointwise  submodularity, enable efficient approximate solution of ASO. Several interesting  classes of functions satisfy these conditions naturally, e.g., the version space reduction function for hypothesis learning. We describe Recursive Adaptive Coverage, a new ASO algorithm that exploits these conditions, and apply the algorithm  to two robot planning tasks under uncertainty. In contrast to the earlier submodular optimization approach, our algorithm applies to ASO over both sets and paths.  
Stochastic convex optimization is a basic and well studied primitive in machine  learning. It is well known that convex and Lipschitz functions can be minimized  efficiently using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).  The Normalized Gradient Descent (NGD) algorithm, is an adaptation of Gradient  Descent, which updates according to the direction of the gradients, rather than the  gradients themselves. In this paper we analyze a stochastic version of NGD and  prove its convergence to a global minimum for a wider class of functions: we  require the functions to be quasi-convex and locally-Lipschitz. Quasi-convexity  broadens the concept of unimodality to multidimensions and allows for certain  types of saddle points, which are a known hurdle for first-order optimization methods such as gradient descent. Locally-Lipschitz functions are only required to be  Lipschitz in a small region around the optimum. This assumption circumvents  gradient explosion, which is another known hurdle for gradient descent variants.  Interestingly, unlike the vanilla SGD algorithm, the stochastic normalized gradient  descent algorithm provably requires a minimal minibatch size.  
The process of dynamic state estimation (filtering) based on point process observations is in general intractable. Numerical sampling techniques are often  practically useful, but lead to limited conceptual insight about optimal encoding/decoding strategies, which are of significant relevance to Computational Neuroscience. We develop an analytically tractable Bayesian approximation to optimal filtering based on point process observations, which allows us to introduce  distributional assumptions about sensory cell properties, that greatly facilitate the  analysis of optimal encoding in situations deviating from common assumptions of  uniform coding. The analytic framework leads to insights which are difficult to  obtain from numerical algorithms, and is consistent with experiments about the  distribution of tuning curve centers. Interestingly, we find that the information  gained from the absence of spikes may be crucial to performance.  
This paper establishes a statistical versus computational trade-off for solving  a basic high-dimensional machine learning problem via a basic convex relaxation method. Specifically, we consider the Sparse Principal Component  Analysis (Sparse PCA) problem, and the family of Sum-of-Squares (SoS, aka  Lasserre/Parillo) convex relaxations. It was well known that in large dimension p,  a planted k-sparse unit vector can be in principle detected using only n ≈ k log p  (Gaussian or Bernoulli) samples, but all efficient (polynomial time) algorithms  known require n ≈ k 2 samples. It was also known that this quadratic gap cannot  be improved by the the most basic semi-definite (SDP, aka spectral) relaxation,  equivalent to a degree-2 SoS algorithms. Here we prove that also degree-4 SoS algorithms cannot improve this quadratic gap. This average-case lower bound adds  to the small collection of hardness results in machine learning for this powerful  family of convex relaxation algorithms. Moreover, our design of moments (or  “pseudo-expectations”) for this lower bound is quite different than previous lower  bounds. Establishing lower bounds for higher degree SoS algorithms for remains  a challenging problem.  
Learning-from-crowds aims to design proper aggregation strategies to infer the  unknown true labels from the noisy labels provided by ordinary web workers.  This paper presents max-margin majority voting (M3 V) to improve the discriminative ability of majority voting and further presents a Bayesian generalization to  incorporate the flexibility of generative methods on modeling noisy observations  with worker confusion matrices. We formulate the joint learning as a regularized  Bayesian inference problem, where the posterior regularization is derived by maximizing the margin between the aggregated score of a potential true label and that  of any alternative label. Our Bayesian model naturally covers the Dawid-Skene  estimator and M3 V. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods are competitive, often achieving better results than state-of-the-art estimators.  
Within a statistical learning setting, we propose and study an iterative regularization algorithm for least squares defined by an incremental gradient method. In  particular, we show that, if all other parameters are fixed a priori, the number of  passes over the data (epochs) acts as a regularization parameter, and prove strong  universal consistency, i.e. almost sure convergence of the risk, as well as sharp  finite sample bounds for the iterates. Our results are a step towards understanding  the effect of multiple epochs in stochastic gradient techniques in machine learning  and rely on integrating statistical and optimization results.    
Random walk kernels measure graph similarity by counting matching walks in    two graphs. In their most popular form of geometric random walk kernels, longer  walks of length k are downweighted by a factor of λk (λ < 1) to ensure convergence of the corresponding geometric series. We know from the field of link  prediction that this downweighting often leads to a phenomenon referred to as  halting: Longer walks are downweighted so much that the similarity score is  completely dominated by the comparison of walks of length 1. This is a naı̈ve  kernel between edges and vertices. We theoretically show that halting may occur  in geometric random walk kernels. We also empirically quantify its impact in simulated datasets and popular graph classification benchmark datasets. Our findings  promise to be instrumental in future graph kernel development and applications of  random walk kernels.  
Gaussian process (GP) models form a core part of probabilistic machine learning.  Considerable research effort has been made into attacking three issues with GP  models: how to compute efficiently when the number of data is large; how to approximate the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian and how to estimate  covariance function parameter posteriors. This paper simultaneously addresses  these, using a variational approximation to the posterior which is sparse in support of the function but otherwise free-form. The result is a Hybrid Monte-Carlo  sampling scheme which allows for a non-Gaussian approximation over the function values and covariance parameters simultaneously, with efficient computations  based on inducing-point sparse GPs. Code to replicate each experiment in this paper is available at github.com/sparseMCMC.  
We study Nyström type subsampling approaches to large scale kernel methods,  and prove learning bounds in the statistical learning setting, where random sampling and high probability estimates are considered. In particular, we prove that  these approaches can achieve optimal learning bounds, provided the subsampling  level is suitably chosen. These results suggest a simple incremental variant of  Nyström Kernel Regularized Least Squares, where the subsampling level implements a form of computational regularization, in the sense that it controls at  the same time regularization and computations. Extensive experimental analysis shows that the considered approach achieves state of the art performances on  benchmark large scale datasets.  
We propose the infinite factorial dynamic model (iFDM), a general Bayesian nonparametric model for source separation. Our model builds on the Markov Indian buffet process to consider a potentially unbounded number of hidden Markov  chains (sources) that evolve independently according to some dynamics, in which  the state space can be either discrete or continuous. For posterior inference, we  develop an algorithm based on particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling that can be  efficiently applied to a wide range of source separation problems. We evaluate the  performance of our iFDM on four well-known applications: multitarget tracking,  cocktail party, power disaggregation, and multiuser detection. Our experimental  results show that our approach for source separation does not only outperform  previous approaches, but it can also handle problems that were computationally  intractable for existing approaches.  
Careful tuning of a regularization parameter is indispensable in many machine  learning tasks because it has a significant impact on generalization performances.  Nevertheless, current practice of regularization parameter tuning is more of an art  than a science, e.g., it is hard to tell how many grid-points would be needed in  cross-validation (CV) for obtaining a solution with sufficiently small CV error. In  this paper we propose a novel framework for computing a lower bound of the CV  errors as a function of the regularization parameter, which we call regularization  path of CV error lower bounds. The proposed framework can be used for providing a theoretical approximation guarantee on a set of solutions in the sense that  how far the CV error of the current best solution could be away from best possible CV error in the entire range of the regularization parameters. Our numerical  experiments demonstrate that a theoretically guaranteed choice of a regularization  parameter in the above sense is possible with reasonable computational costs.  
Rodents navigating in a well–known environment can rapidly learn and revisit observed reward locations, often after a single trial. While the mechanism for rapid  path planning is unknown, the CA3 region in the hippocampus plays an important  role, and emerging evidence suggests that place cell activity during hippocampal “preplay” periods may trace out future goal–directed trajectories. Here, we  show how a particular mapping of space allows for the immediate generation of  trajectories between arbitrary start and goal locations in an environment, based  only on the mapped representation of the goal. We show that this representation  can be implemented in a neural attractor network model, resulting in bump–like  activity profiles resembling those of the CA3 region of hippocampus. Neurons  tend to locally excite neurons with similar place field centers, while inhibiting  other neurons with distant place field centers, such that stable bumps of activity  can form at arbitrary locations in the environment. The network is initialized to  represent a point in the environment, then weakly stimulated with an input corresponding to an arbitrary goal location. We show that the resulting activity can  be interpreted as a gradient ascent on the value function induced by a reward at  the goal location. Indeed, in networks with large place fields, we show that the  network properties cause the bump to move smoothly from its initial location to  the goal, around obstacles or walls. Our results illustrate that an attractor network  with hippocampal–like attributes may be important for rapid path planning.  
Teaching machines to read natural language documents remains an elusive challenge. Machine reading systems can be tested on their ability to answer questions  posed on the contents of documents that they have seen, but until now large scale  training and test datasets have been missing for this type of evaluation. In this  work we define a new methodology that resolves this bottleneck and provides  large scale supervised reading comprehension data. This allows us to develop a  class of attention based deep neural networks that learn to read real documents and  answer complex questions with minimal prior knowledge of language structure.  
We introduce principal differences analysis (PDA) for analyzing differences between high-dimensional distributions. The method operates by finding the projection that maximizes the Wasserstein divergence between the resulting univariate populations. Relying on the Cramer-Wold device, it requires no assumptions  about the form of the underlying distributions, nor the nature of their inter-class  differences. A sparse variant of the method is introduced to identify features responsible for the differences. We provide algorithms for both the original minimax  formulation as well as its semidefinite relaxation. In addition to deriving some  convergence results, we illustrate how the approach may be applied to identify differences between cell populations in the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus  as manifested by single cell RNA-seq. Our broader framework extends beyond  the specific choice of Wasserstein divergence.  
We study the restless bandit associated with an extremely simple scalar Kalman  filter model in discrete time. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the problem is indexable in the sense that the Whittle index is a non-decreasing function of  the relevant belief state. In spite of the long history of this problem, this appears  to be the first such proof. We use results about Schur-convexity and mechanical  words, which are particular binary strings intimately related to palindromes.  
Bayesian networks are a popular representation of asymmetric (for example  causal) relationships between random variables. Markov random fields (MRFs)  are a complementary model of symmetric relationships used in computer vision,  spatial modeling, and social and gene expression networks. A chain graph model  under the Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg interpretation (hereafter a chain graph  model) generalizes both Bayesian networks and MRFs, and can represent asymmetric and symmetric relationships together.  As in other graphical models, the set of marginals from distributions in a chain  graph model induced by the presence of hidden variables forms a complex model.  One recent approach to the study of marginal graphical models is to consider a  well-behaved supermodel. Such a supermodel of marginals of Bayesian networks,  defined only by conditional independences, and termed the ordinary Markov  model, was studied at length in [6].  
In this paper, we show that special mixed graphs which we call segregated graphs  can be associated, via a Markov property, with supermodels of marginals of chain  graphs defined only by conditional independences. Special features of segregated  graphs imply the existence of a very natural factorization for these supermodels, and imply many existing results on the chain graph model, and the ordinary  Markov model carry over. Our results suggest that segregated graphs define an  analogue of the ordinary Markov model for marginals of chain graph models.  We illustrate the utility of segregated graphs for analyzing outcome interference  in causal inference via simulated datasets.  
Decision trees and randomized forests are widely used in computer vision and machine learning. Standard algorithms for decision tree induction optimize the split  functions one node at a time according to some splitting criteria. This greedy procedure often leads to suboptimal trees. In this paper, we present an algorithm for  optimizing the split functions at all levels of the tree jointly with the leaf parameters, based on a global objective. We show that the problem of finding optimal  linear-combination (oblique) splits for decision trees is related to structured prediction with latent variables, and we formulate a convex-concave upper bound on  the tree’s empirical loss. Computing the gradient of the proposed surrogate objective with respect to each training exemplar is O(d2 ), where d is the tree depth,  and thus training deep trees is feasible. The use of stochastic gradient descent for  optimization enables effective training with large datasets. Experiments on several classification benchmarks demonstrate that the resulting non-greedy decision  trees outperform greedy decision tree baselines.  
Learning of low dimensional structure in multidimensional data is a canonical  problem in machine learning. One common approach is to suppose that the observed data are close to a lower-dimensional smooth manifold. There are a rich  variety of manifold learning methods available, which allow mapping of data  points to the manifold. However, there is a clear lack of probabilistic methods  that allow learning of the manifold along with the generative distribution of the  observed data. The best attempt is the Gaussian process latent variable model  (GP-LVM), but identifiability issues lead to poor performance. We solve these  issues by proposing a novel Coulomb repulsive process (Corp) for locations of  points on the manifold, inspired by physical models of electrostatic interactions  among particles. Combining this process with a GP prior for the mapping function  yields a novel electrostatic GP (electroGP) process. Focusing on the simple case  of a one-dimensional manifold, we develop efficient inference algorithms, and illustrate substantially improved performance in a variety of experiments including  filling in missing frames in video.  
Existing inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms have assumed each expert’s demonstrated trajectory to be produced by only a single reward function.  This paper presents a novel generalization of the IRL problem that allows each  trajectory to be generated by multiple locally consistent reward functions, hence  catering to more realistic and complex experts’ behaviors. Solving our generalized IRL problem thus involves not only learning these reward functions but  also the stochastic transitions between them at any state (including unvisited  states). By representing our IRL problem with a probabilistic graphical model,  an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm can be devised to iteratively learn  the different reward functions and the stochastic transitions between them in order  to jointly improve the likelihood of the expert’s demonstrated trajectories. As a  result, the most likely partition of a trajectory into segments that are generated  from different locally consistent reward functions selected by EM can be derived.  Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets shows that our IRL algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art EM clustering with maximum likelihood  IRL, which is, interestingly, a reduced variant of our approach.  
We study the fundamental limits to communication-efficient distributed methods  for convex learning and optimization, under different assumptions on the information available to individual machines, and the types of functions considered. We  identify cases where existing algorithms are already worst-case optimal, as well as  cases where room for further improvement is still possible. Among other things,  our results indicate that without similarity between the local objective functions  (due to statistical data similarity or otherwise) many communication rounds may  be required, even if the machines have unbounded computational power.  
We develop a fully discriminative learning approach for supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model using Back Propagation (i.e., BP-sLDA), which maximizes the posterior probability of the prediction variable given the input document. Different from traditional variational learning or Gibbs sampling approaches, the proposed learning method applies (i) the mirror descent algorithm  for maximum a posterior inference and (ii) back propagation over a deep architecture together with stochastic gradient/mirror descent for model parameter estimation, leading to scalable and end-to-end discriminative learning of the model. As  a byproduct, we also apply this technique to develop a new learning method for  the traditional unsupervised LDA model (i.e., BP-LDA). Experimental results on  three real-world regression and classification tasks show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the previous supervised topic models, neural networks, and is on par with deep neural networks.    
Selecting the optimal subset from a large set of variables is a fundamental problem  in various learning tasks such as feature selection, sparse regression, dictionary  learning, etc. In this paper, we propose the POSS approach which employs evolutionary Pareto optimization to find a small-sized subset with good performance.  We prove that for sparse regression, POSS is able to achieve the best-so-far theoretically guaranteed approximation performance efficiently. Particularly, for the  Exponential Decay subclass, POSS is proven to achieve an optimal solution. Empirical study verifies the theoretical results, and exhibits the superior performance  of POSS to greedy and convex relaxation methods.  
Calculation of the log-normalizer is a major computational obstacle in applications of log-linear models with large output spaces. The problem of fast normalizer computation has therefore attracted significant attention in the theoretical and  applied machine learning literature. In this paper, we analyze a recently proposed  technique known as “self-normalization”, which introduces a regularization term  in training to penalize log normalizers for deviating from zero. This makes it possible to use unnormalized model scores as approximate probabilities. Empirical  evidence suggests that self-normalization is extremely effective, but a theoretical  understanding of why it should work, and how generally it can be applied, is  largely lacking.  We prove upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to self-normalization, describe  classes of input distributions that self-normalize easily, and construct explicit examples of high-variance input distributions. Our theoretical results make predictions about the difficulty of fitting self-normalized models to several classes of  distributions, and we conclude with empirical validation of these predictions.  
Partial monitoring is a general model for sequential learning with limited feedback formalized as a game between two players. In this game, the learner chooses  an action and at the same time the opponent chooses an outcome, then the learner  suffers a loss and receives a feedback signal. The goal of the learner is to minimize the total loss. In this paper, we study partial monitoring with finite actions  and stochastic outcomes. We derive a logarithmic distribution-dependent regret  lower bound that defines the hardness of the problem. Inspired by the DMED  algorithm (Honda and Takemura, 2010) for the multi-armed bandit problem, we  propose PM-DMED, an algorithm that minimizes the distribution-dependent regret. PM-DMED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in numerical experiments. To show the optimality of PM-DMED with respect to the regret  bound, we slightly modify the algorithm by introducing a hinge function (PMDMED-Hinge). Then, we derive an asymptotically optimal regret upper bound of  PM-DMED-Hinge that matches the lower bound.  
Some crowdsourcing platforms ask workers to express their opinions by approving a set of k good alternatives. It seems that the only reasonable way to aggregate  these k-approval votes is the approval voting rule, which simply counts the number of times each alternative was approved. We challenge this assertion by proposing a probabilistic framework of noisy voting, and asking whether approval voting  yields an alternative that is most likely to be the best alternative, given k-approval  votes. While the answer is generally positive, our theoretical and empirical results  call attention to situations where approval voting is suboptimal.  
We are interested in supervised metric learning of Mahalanobis like distances.  Existing approaches mainly focus on learning a new distance using similarity  and dissimilarity constraints between examples. In this paper, instead of bringing closer examples of the same class and pushing far away examples of different  classes we propose to move the examples with respect to virtual points. Hence,  each example is brought closer to a a priori defined virtual point reducing the  number of constraints to satisfy. We show that our approach admits a closed form  solution which can be kernelized. We provide a theoretical analysis showing the  consistency of the approach and establishing some links with other classical metric learning methods. Furthermore we propose an efficient solution to the difficult  problem of selecting virtual points based in part on recent works in optimal transport. Lastly, we evaluate our approach on several state of the art datasets.  
We investigate the robust PCA problem of decomposing an observed matrix into  the sum of a low-rank and a sparse error matrices via convex programming Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). In contrast to previous studies that assume the  support of the error matrix is generated by uniform Bernoulli sampling, we allow  non-uniform sampling, i.e., entries of the low-rank matrix are corrupted by errors with unequal probabilities. We characterize conditions on error corruption of  each individual entry based on the local incoherence of the low-rank matrix, under  which correct matrix decomposition by PCP is guaranteed. Such a refined analysis of robust PCA captures how robust each entry of the low rank matrix combats  error corruption. In order to deal with non-uniform error corruption, our technical  proof introduces a new weighted norm and develops/exploits the concentration  properties that such a norm satisfies.  
Recently, strong results have been demonstrated by Deep Recurrent Neural Networks on natural language transduction problems. In this paper we explore the  representational power of these models using synthetic grammars designed to exhibit phenomena similar to those found in real transduction problems such as machine translation. These experiments lead us to propose new memory-based recurrent networks that implement continuously differentiable analogues of traditional  data structures such as Stacks, Queues, and DeQues. We show that these architectures exhibit superior generalisation performance to Deep RNNs and are often able  to learn the underlying generating algorithms in our transduction experiments.  
Deep generative models (DGMs) are effective on learning multilayered representations of complex data and performing inference of input data by exploring the  generative ability. However, little work has been done on examining or empowering the discriminative ability of DGMs on making accurate predictions. This paper presents max-margin deep generative models (mmDGMs), which explore the  strongly discriminative principle of max-margin learning to improve the discriminative power of DGMs, while retaining the generative capability. We develop an  efficient doubly stochastic subgradient algorithm for the piecewise linear objective. Empirical results on MNIST and SVHN datasets demonstrate that (1) maxmargin learning can significantly improve the prediction performance of DGMs  and meanwhile retain the generative ability; and (2) mmDGMs are competitive to  the state-of-the-art fully discriminative networks by employing deep convolutional  neural networks (CNNs) as both recognition and generative models.  
Compact explicit feature maps provide a practical framework to scale kernel methods to large-scale learning, but deriving such maps for many types of kernels  remains a challenging open problem. Among the commonly used kernels for nonlinear classification are polynomial kernels, for which low approximation error  has thus far necessitated explicit feature maps of large dimensionality, especially  for higher-order polynomials. Meanwhile, because polynomial kernels are unbounded, they are frequently applied to data that has been normalized to unit `2  norm. The question we address in this work is: if we know a priori that data is  normalized, can we devise a more compact map? We show that a putative affirmative answer to this question based on Random Fourier Features is impossible  in this setting, and introduce a new approximation paradigm, Spherical Random  Fourier (SRF) features, which circumvents these issues and delivers a compact  approximation to polynomial kernels for data on the unit sphere. Compared to  prior work, SRF features are less rank-deficient, more compact, and achieve better kernel approximation, especially for higher-order polynomials. The resulting  predictions have lower variance and typically yield better classification accuracy.  
We propose rectified factor networks (RFNs) to efficiently construct very sparse,  non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input. RFN models identify  rare and small events in the input, have a low interference between code units,  have a small reconstruction error, and explain the data covariance structure. RFN  learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm derived from the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. We proof convergence and correctness of the RFN learning algorithm.  On benchmarks, RFNs are compared to other unsupervised methods like autoencoders, RBMs, factor analysis, ICA, and PCA. In contrast to previous sparse  coding methods, RFNs yield sparser codes, capture the data’s covariance structure more precisely, and have a significantly smaller reconstruction error. We  test RFNs as pretraining technique for deep networks on different vision datasets,  where RFNs were superior to RBMs and autoencoders. On gene expression data  from two pharmaceutical drug discovery studies, RFNs detected small and rare  gene modules that revealed highly relevant new biological insights which were so  far missed by other unsupervised methods.  RFN package for GPU/CPU is available at http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/rfn.  
We present a method for learning Bayesian networks from data sets containing  thousands of variables without the need for structure constraints. Our approach  is made of two parts. The first is a novel algorithm that effectively explores the  space of possible parent sets of a node. It guides the exploration towards the  most promising parent sets on the basis of an approximated score function that  is computed in constant time. The second part is an improvement of an existing  ordering-based algorithm for structure optimization. The new algorithm provably  achieves a higher score compared to its original formulation. Our novel approach  consistently outperforms the state of the art on very large data sets.  
Most recent results in matrix completion assume that the matrix under consideration is low-rank or that the columns are in a union of low-rank subspaces. In  real-world settings, however, the linear structure underlying these models is distorted by a (typically unknown) nonlinear transformation. This paper addresses  the challenge of matrix completion in the face of such nonlinearities. Given a  few observations of a matrix that are obtained by applying a Lipschitz, monotonic  function to a low rank matrix, our task is to estimate the remaining unobserved entries. We propose a novel matrix completion method that alternates between lowrank matrix estimation and monotonic function estimation to estimate the missing  matrix elements. Mean squared error bounds provide insight into how well the  matrix can be estimated based on the size, rank of the matrix and properties of the  nonlinear transformation. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets  demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed approach.  
In this paper, we study the problem of answering visual analogy questions. These  questions take the form of image A is to image B as image C is to what. Answering these questions entails discovering the mapping from image A to image B and  then extending the mapping to image C and searching for the image D such that  the relation from A to B holds for C to D. We pose this problem as learning an embedding that encourages pairs of analogous images with similar transformations to  be close together using convolutional neural networks with a quadruple Siamese  architecture. We introduce a dataset of visual analogy questions in natural images,  and show first results of its kind on solving analogy questions on natural images.  
Normalized random measures (NRMs) provide a broad class of discrete random  measures that are often used as priors for Bayesian nonparametric models. Dirichlet process is a well-known example of NRMs. Most of posterior inference methods for NRM mixture models rely on MCMC methods since they are easy to  implement and their convergence is well studied. However, MCMC often suffers  from slow convergence when the acceptance rate is low. Tree-based inference is  an alternative deterministic posterior inference method, where Bayesian hierarchical clustering (BHC) or incremental Bayesian hierarchical clustering (IBHC) have  been developed for DP or NRM mixture (NRMM) models, respectively. Although  IBHC is a promising method for posterior inference for NRMM models due to its  efficiency and applicability to online inference, its convergence is not guaranteed  since it uses heuristics that simply selects the best solution after multiple trials are  made. In this paper, we present a hybrid inference algorithm for NRMM models,  which combines the merits of both MCMC and IBHC. Trees built by IBHC outlines partitions of data, which guides Metropolis-Hastings procedure to employ  appropriate proposals. Inheriting the nature of MCMC, our tree-guided MCMC  (tgMCMC) is guaranteed to converge, and enjoys the fast convergence thanks to  the effective proposals guided by trees. Experiments on both synthetic and realworld datasets demonstrate the benefit of our method.  
In many applications, the data is of rich structure that can be represented by a  hypergraph, where the data items are represented by vertices and the associations  among items are represented by hyperedges. Equivalently, we are given an input  bipartite graph with two types of vertices: items, and associations (which we refer  to as topics). We consider the problem of partitioning the set of items into a given  number of components such that the maximum number of topics covered by a  component is minimized. This is a clustering problem with various applications,  e.g. partitioning of a set of information objects such as documents, images, and  videos, and load balancing in the context of modern computation platforms.  In this paper, we focus on the streaming computation model for this problem, in  which items arrive online one at a time and each item must be assigned irrevocably  to a component at its arrival time. Motivated by scalability requirements, we focus  on the class of streaming computation algorithms with memory limited to be at  most linear in the number of components. We show that a greedy assignment  strategy is able to recover a hidden co-clustering of items under a natural set of  recovery conditions. We also report results of an extensive empirical evaluation,  which demonstrate that this greedy strategy yields superior performance when  compared with alternative approaches.  
In personalized recommendation systems, it is important to predict preferences of  a user on items that have not been seen by that user yet. Similarly, in revenue  management, it is important to predict outcomes of comparisons among those  items that have never been compared so far. The MultiNomial Logit model, a  popular discrete choice model, captures the structure of the hidden preferences  with a low-rank matrix. In order to predict the preferences, we want to learn the  underlying model from noisy observations of the low-rank matrix, collected as  revealed preferences in various forms of ordinal data. A natural approach to learn  such a model is to solve a convex relaxation of nuclear norm minimization. We  present the convex relaxation approach in two contexts of interest: collaborative  ranking and bundled choice modeling. In both cases, we show that the convex  relaxation is minimax optimal. We prove an upper bound on the resulting error  with finite samples, and provide a matching information-theoretic lower bound.  
Perception is often described as a predictive process based on an optimal inference  with respect to a generative model. We study here the principled construction  of a generative model specifically crafted to probe motion perception. In that  context, we first provide an axiomatic, biologically-driven derivation of the model.  This model synthesizes random dynamic textures which are defined by stationary  Gaussian distributions obtained by the random aggregation of warped patterns.  Importantly, we show that this model can equivalently be described as a stochastic  partial differential equation. Using this characterization of motion in images, it  allows us to recast motion-energy models into a principled Bayesian inference  framework. Finally, we apply these textures in order to psychophysically probe  speed perception in humans. In this framework, while the likelihood is derived  from the generative model, the prior is estimated from the observed results and  accounts for the perceptual bias in a principled fashion.  
Modeling the distribution of natural images is challenging, partly because of  strong statistical dependencies which can extend over hundreds of pixels. Recurrent neural networks have been successful in capturing long-range dependencies in a number of problems but only recently have found their way into generative image models. We here introduce a recurrent image model based on multidimensional long short-term memory units which are particularly suited for image  modeling due to their spatial structure. Our model scales to images of arbitrary  size and its likelihood is computationally tractable. We find that it outperforms the  state of the art in quantitative comparisons on several image datasets and produces  promising results when used for texture synthesis and inpainting.  
The robust principal component analysis (RPCA) problem seeks to separate lowrank trends from sparse outliers within a data matrix, that is, to approximate a n⇥d  matrix D as the sum of a low-rank matrix L and a sparse matrix S. We examine  the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) problem under data compression,  where the data Y is approximately given by (L+S)·C, that is, a low-rank + sparse  data matrix that has been compressed to size n ⇥ m (with m substantially smaller  than the original dimension d) via multiplication with a compression matrix C.  We give a convex program for recovering the sparse component S along with the  compressed low-rank component L · C, along with upper bounds on the error of  this reconstruction that scales naturally with the compression dimension m and  coincides with existing results for the uncompressed setting m = d. Our results  can also handle error introduced through additive noise or through missing data.  The scaling of dimension, compression, and signal complexity in our theoretical  results is verified empirically through simulations, and we also apply our method  to a data set measuring chlorine concentration across a network of sensors to test  its performance in practice.  
Submodular and supermodular functions have found wide applicability in machine learning, capturing notions such as diversity and regularity, respectively.  These notions have deep consequences for optimization, and the problem of (approximately) optimizing submodular functions has received much attention. However, beyond optimization, these notions allow specifying expressive probabilistic models that can be used to quantify predictive uncertainty via marginal inference. Prominent, well-studied special cases include Ising models and determinantal point processes, but the general class of log-submodular and log-supermodular  models is much richer and little studied. In this paper, we investigate the use of  Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to perform approximate inference in general log-submodular and log-supermodular models. In particular, we consider a  simple Gibbs sampling procedure, and establish two sufficient conditions, the first  guaranteeing polynomial-time, and the second fast (O(n log n)) mixing. We also  evaluate the efficiency of the Gibbs sampler on three examples of such models,  and compare against a recently proposed variational approach.  
Information diffusion in online social networks is affected by the underlying network topology, but it also has the power to change it. Online users are constantly  creating new links when exposed to new information sources, and in turn these  links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes, information diffusion and network evolution, have  been predominantly studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics.  We propose a temporal point process model, COEVOLVE, for such joint dynamics, allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other.  This model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network  events, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real-world networks. Furthermore, we also develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and  network evolution traces. We experimented with both synthetic data and data gathered from Twitter, and show that our model provides a good fit to the data as  well as more accurate predictions than alternatives.  
Recently there has been substantial interest in spectral methods for learning dynamical systems. These methods are popular since they often offer a good tradeoff  between computational and statistical efficiency. Unfortunately, they can be difficult to use and extend in practice: e.g., they can make it difficult to incorporate  prior information such as sparsity or structure. To address this problem, we present  a new view of dynamical system learning: we show how to learn dynamical systems by solving a sequence of ordinary supervised learning problems, thereby  allowing users to incorporate prior knowledge via standard techniques such as  L1 regularization. Many existing spectral methods are special cases of this new  framework, using linear regression as the supervised learner. We demonstrate the  effectiveness of our framework by showing examples where nonlinear regression  or lasso let us learn better state representations than plain linear regression does;  the correctness of these instances follows directly from our general analysis.  
Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a leading algorithm for finding a  Nash equilibrium in large zero-sum imperfect-information games. CFR is an iterative algorithm that repeatedly traverses the game tree, updating regrets at each  information set. We introduce an improvement to CFR that prunes any path of play  in the tree, and its descendants, that has negative regret. It revisits that sequence  at the earliest subsequent CFR iteration where the regret could have become positive, had that path been explored on every iteration. The new algorithm maintains  CFR’s convergence guarantees while making iterations significantly faster—even  if previously known pruning techniques are used in the comparison. This improvement carries over to CFR+, a recent variant of CFR. Experiments show an order  of magnitude speed improvement, and the relative speed improvement increases  with the size of the game.  
We propose a class of nonparametric two-sample tests with a cost linear in the  sample size. Two tests are given, both based on an ensemble of distances between analytic functions representing each of the distributions. The first test uses  smoothed empirical characteristic functions to represent the distributions, the second uses distribution embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Analyticity implies that differences in the distributions may be detected almost surely at a  finite number of randomly chosen locations/frequencies. The new tests are consistent against a larger class of alternatives than the previous linear-time tests based  on the (non-smoothed) empirical characteristic functions, while being much faster  than the current state-of-the-art quadratic-time kernel-based or energy distancebased tests. Experiments on artificial benchmarks and on challenging real-world  testing problems demonstrate that our tests give a better power/time tradeoff than  competing approaches, and in some cases, better outright power than even the  most expensive quadratic-time tests. This performance advantage is retained even  in high dimensions, and in cases where the difference in distributions is not observable with low order statistics.  
Recent object detection systems rely on two critical steps: (1) a set of object proposals is predicted as efficiently as possible, and (2) this set of candidate proposals  is then passed to an object classifier. Such approaches have been shown they can  be fast, while achieving the state of the art in detection performance. In this paper, we propose a new way to generate object proposals, introducing an approach  based on a discriminative convolutional network. Our model is trained jointly  with two objectives: given an image patch, the first part of the system outputs a  class-agnostic segmentation mask, while the second part of the system outputs the  likelihood of the patch being centered on a full object. At test time, the model  is efficiently applied on the whole test image and generates a set of segmentation masks, each of them being assigned with a corresponding object likelihood  score. We show that our model yields significant improvements over state-of-theart object proposal algorithms. In particular, compared to previous approaches,  our model obtains substantially higher object recall using fewer proposals. We  also show that our model is able to generalize to unseen categories it has not seen  during training. Unlike all previous approaches for generating object masks, we  do not rely on edges, superpixels, or any other form of low-level segmentation.  
Multi-output Gaussian processes provide a convenient framework for multi-task  problems. An illustrative and motivating example of a multi-task problem is  multi-region electrophysiological time-series data, where experimentalists are interested in both power and phase coherence between channels. Recently, Wilson  and Adams (2013) proposed the spectral mixture (SM) kernel to model the spectral density of a single task in a Gaussian process framework. In this paper, we  develop a novel covariance kernel for multiple outputs, called the cross-spectral  mixture (CSM) kernel. This new, flexible kernel represents both the power and  phase relationship between multiple observation channels. We demonstrate the  expressive capabilities of the CSM kernel through implementation of a Bayesian  hidden Markov model, where the emission distribution is a multi-output Gaussian process with a CSM covariance kernel. Results are presented for measured  multi-region electrophysiological data.  
We study the problem of interactive function computation by multiple parties,  each possessing a bit, in a differential privacy setting (i.e., there remains an uncertainty in any party’s bit even when given the transcript of interactions and all the  other parties’ bits). Each party wants to compute a function, which could differ  from party to party, and there could be a central observer interested in computing  a separate function. Performance at each party is measured via the accuracy of  the function to be computed. We allow for an arbitrary cost metric to measure  the distortion between the true and the computed function values. Our main result is the optimality of a simple non-interactive protocol: each party randomizes  its bit (sufficiently) and shares the privatized version with the other parties. This  optimality result is very general: it holds for all types of functions, heterogeneous  privacy conditions on the parties, all types of cost metrics, and both average and  worst-case (over the inputs) measures of accuracy.  
Convolutional Neural Networks define an exceptionally powerful class of models,  but are still limited by the lack of ability to be spatially invariant to the input data  in a computationally and parameter efficient manner. In this work we introduce a  new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be  inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map  itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation  process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which  learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of  classes of transformations.  
The paper studies transition phenomena in information cascades observed along  a diffusion process over some graph. We introduce the Laplace Hazard matrix  and show that its spectral radius fully characterizes the dynamics of the contagion both in terms of influence and of explosion time. Using this concept, we  prove tight non-asymptotic bounds for the influence of a set of nodes, and we  also provide an in-depth analysis of the critical time after which the contagion becomes super-critical. Our contributions include formal definitions and tight lower  bounds of critical explosion time. We illustrate the relevance of our theoretical results through several examples of information cascades used in epidemiology and  viral marketing models. Finally, we provide a series of numerical experiments for  various types of networks which confirm the tightness of the theoretical bounds.  
This paper studies the generalization performance of multi-class classification algorithms, for which we obtain—for the first time—a data-dependent generalization error bound with a logarithmic dependence on the class size, substantially  improving the state-of-the-art linear dependence in the existing data-dependent  generalization analysis. The theoretical analysis motivates us to introduce a new  multi-class classification machine based on `p -norm regularization, where the parameter p controls the complexity of the corresponding bounds. We derive an  efficient optimization algorithm based on Fenchel duality theory. Benchmarks on  several real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant accuracy gains over the state of the art.  
Latent factor models have been widely used to analyze simultaneous recordings of spike trains from large, heterogeneous neural populations. These models assume  the signal of interest in the population is a low-dimensional latent intensity that  evolves over time, which is observed in high dimension via noisy point-process  observations. These techniques have been well used to capture neural correlations  across a population and to provide a smooth, denoised, and concise representation of high-dimensional spiking data. One limitation of many current models  is that the observation model is assumed to be Poisson, which lacks the flexibility to capture under- and over-dispersion that is common in recorded neural data,  thereby introducing bias into estimates of covariance. Here we develop the generalized count linear dynamical system, which relaxes the Poisson assumption by  using a more general exponential family for count data. In addition to containing Poisson, Bernoulli, negative binomial, and other common count distributions  as special cases, we show that this model can be tractably learned by extending recent advances in variational inference techniques. We apply our model to  data from primate motor cortex and demonstrate performance improvements over  state-of-the-art methods, both in capturing the variance structure of the data and  in held-out prediction.  
Learning to predict multi-label outputs is challenging, but in many problems there  is a natural metric on the outputs that can be used to improve predictions. In this  paper we develop a loss function for multi-label learning, based on the Wasserstein  distance. The Wasserstein distance provides a natural notion of dissimilarity for  probability measures. Although optimizing with respect to the exact Wasserstein  distance is costly, recent work has described a regularized approximation that is  efficiently computed. We describe an efficient learning algorithm based on this  regularization, as well as a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance from probability measures to unnormalized measures. We also describe a statistical learning  bound for the loss. The Wasserstein loss can encourage smoothness of the predictions with respect to a chosen metric on the output space. We demonstrate this  property on a real-data tag prediction problem, using the Yahoo Flickr Creative  Commons dataset, outperforming a baseline that doesn’t use the metric.  
We consider the problem of sparse signal recovery from m linear measurements  quantized to b bits. b-bit Marginal Regression is proposed as recovery algorithm.  We study the question of choosing b in the setting of a given budget of bits B =  m · b and derive a single easy-to-compute expression characterizing the trade-off  between m and b. The choice b = 1 turns out to be optimal for estimating the unit  vector corresponding to the signal for any level of additive Gaussian noise before  quantization as well as for adversarial noise. For b ≥ 2, we show that Lloyd-Max  quantization constitutes an optimal quantization scheme and that the norm of the  signal can be estimated consistently by maximum likelihood by extending [15].  
We introduce Natural Neural Networks, a novel family of algorithms that speed up  convergence by adapting their internal representation during training to improve  conditioning of the Fisher matrix. In particular, we show a specific example that  employs a simple and efficient reparametrization of the neural network weights by  implicitly whitening the representation obtained at each layer, while preserving  the feed-forward computation of the network. Such networks can be trained efficiently via the proposed Projected Natural Gradient Descent algorithm (PRONG),  which amortizes the cost of these reparametrizations over many parameter updates and is closely related to the Mirror Descent online learning algorithm. We  highlight the benefits of our method on both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, and showcase its scalability by training on the large-scale ImageNet  Challenge dataset.  
We describe an embarrassingly parallel, anytime Monte Carlo method for  likelihood-free models. The algorithm starts with the view that the stochasticity of the pseudo-samples generated by the simulator can be controlled externally  by a vector of random numbers u, in such a way that the outcome, knowing u,  is deterministic. For each instantiation of u we run an optimization procedure to  minimize the distance between summary statistics of the simulator and the data.  After reweighing these samples using the prior and the Jacobian (accounting for  the change of volume in transforming from the space of summary statistics to the  space of parameters) we show that this weighted ensemble represents a Monte  Carlo estimate of the posterior distribution. The procedure can be run embarrassingly parallel (each node handling one sample) and anytime (by allocating  resources to the worst performing sample). The procedure is validated on six experiments.  
The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is an important tool for  solving complex optimization problems, but it involves minimization sub-steps  that are often difficult to solve efficiently. The Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient  (PDHG) method is a powerful alternative that often has simpler sub-steps than  ADMM, thus producing lower complexity solvers. Despite the flexibility of this  method, PDHG is often impractical because it requires the careful choice of multiple stepsize parameters. There is often no intuitive way to choose these parameters  to maximize efficiency, or even achieve convergence. We propose self-adaptive  stepsize rules that automatically tune PDHG parameters for optimal convergence.  We rigorously analyze our methods, and identify convergence rates. Numerical  experiments show that adaptive PDHG has strong advantages over non-adaptive  methods in terms of both efficiency and simplicity for the user.  
Variational inference is an efficient, popular heuristic used in the context of latent  variable models. We provide the first analysis of instances where variational inference algorithms converge to the global optimum, in the setting of topic models.  Our initializations are natural, one of them being used in LDA-c, the most popular  implementation of variational inference. In addition to providing intuition into  why this heuristic might work in practice, the multiplicative, rather than additive  nature of the variational inference updates forces us to use non-standard proof  arguments, which we believe might be of general theoretical interest.  
Low rank matrix completion plays a fundamental role in collaborative filtering  applications, the key idea being that the variables lie in a smaller subspace than  the ambient space. Often, additional information about the variables is known,  and it is reasonable to assume that incorporating this information will lead to  better predictions. We tackle the problem of matrix completion when pairwise  relationships among variables are known, via a graph. We formulate and derive  a highly efficient, conjugate gradient based alternating minimization scheme that  solves optimizations with over 55 million observations up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art (stochastic) gradient-descent based methods. On  the theoretical front, we show that such methods generalize weighted nuclear norm  formulations, and derive statistical consistency guarantees. We validate our results  on both real and synthetic datasets.  
This paper investigates stochastic and adversarial combinatorial multi-armed bandit problems. In the stochastic setting under semi-bandit feedback, we derive  a problem-specific regret lower bound, and discuss its scaling with the dimension of the decision space. We propose ESCB, an algorithm that efficiently exploits the structure of the problem and provide a finite-time analysis of its regret.  ESCB has better performance guarantees than existing algorithms, and significantly outperforms these algorithms in practice. In the adversarial setting under  bandit feedback, we propose C OMB EXP, an algorithm with the same regret scaling as state-of-the-art algorithms, but with lower computational complexity for  some combinatorial problems.  
The mutual information is a core statistical quantity that has applications in all areas of machine learning, whether this is in training of density models over multiple  data modalities, in maximising the efficiency of noisy transmission channels, or  when learning behaviour policies for exploration by artificial agents. Most learning algorithms that involve optimisation of the mutual information rely on the  Blahut-Arimoto algorithm — an enumerative algorithm with exponential complexity that is not suitable for modern machine learning applications. This paper  provides a new approach for scalable optimisation of the mutual information by  merging techniques from variational inference and deep learning. We develop our  approach by focusing on the problem of intrinsically-motivated learning, where  the mutual information forms the definition of a well-known internal drive known  as empowerment. Using a variational lower bound on the mutual information,  combined with convolutional networks for handling visual input streams, we develop a stochastic optimisation algorithm that allows for scalable information  maximisation and empowerment-based reasoning directly from pixels to actions.  
In this paper, we propose a general smoothing framework for graph kernels by  taking structural similarity into account, and apply it to derive smoothed variants  of popular graph kernels. Our framework is inspired by state-of-the-art smoothing  techniques used in natural language processing (NLP). However, unlike NLP applications that primarily deal with strings, we show how one can apply smoothing  to a richer class of inter-dependent sub-structures that naturally arise in graphs.  Moreover, we discuss extensions of the Pitman-Yor process that can be adapted  to smooth structured objects, thereby leading to novel graph kernels. Our kernels  are able to tackle the diagonal dominance problem while respecting the structural  similarity between features. Experimental evaluation shows that not only our kernels achieve statistically significant improvements over the unsmoothed variants,  but also outperform several other graph kernels in the literature. Our kernels are  competitive in terms of runtime, and offer a viable option for practitioners.  
Estimating distributions over large alphabets is a fundamental machine-learning  tenet. Yet no method is known to estimate all distributions well. For example,  add-constant estimators are nearly min-max optimal but often perform poorly in  practice, and practical estimators such as absolute discounting, Jelinek-Mercer,  and Good-Turing are not known to be near optimal for essentially any distribution.  We describe the first universally near-optimal probability estimators. For every  discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the best  estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to a permutation.  Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but as all natural estimators,  restricted to assign the same probability to all symbols appearing the same number  of times.  Specifically, for distributions over k symbols and n samples, we show that for  both comparisons, a simple variant of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL  divergence of (3 + on (1))/n1/3 from the best estimator, and that a more involved  √  estimator is within O˜n (min(k/n, 1/ n)). Conversely, we show that any estimator must have a KL divergence at least Ω̃n (min(k/n, 1/n2/3 )) over the best  √  estimator for the first comparison, and at least Ω̃n (min(k/n, 1/ n)) for the second.  
We study the problem of reducing test-time acquisition costs in classification systems. Our goal is to learn decision rules that adaptively select sensors for each  example as necessary to make a confident prediction. We model our system as a  directed acyclic graph (DAG) where internal nodes correspond to sensor subsets  and decision functions at each node choose whether to acquire a new sensor or  classify using the available measurements. This problem can be posed as an empirical risk minimization over training data. Rather than jointly optimizing such  a highly coupled and non-convex problem over all decision nodes, we propose an  efficient algorithm motivated by dynamic programming. We learn node policies  in the DAG by reducing the global objective to a series of cost sensitive learning  problems. Our approach is computationally efficient and has proven guarantees of  convergence to the optimal system for a fixed architecture. In addition, we present  an extension to map other budgeted learning problems with large number of sensors to our DAG architecture and demonstrate empirical performance exceeding  state-of-the-art algorithms for data composed of both few and many sensors.  
This paper concerns the introduction of a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme  for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models with priors that  belong to the general Poisson-Kingman class. We present a novel compact way  of representing the infinite dimensional component of the model such that while  explicitly representing this infinite component it has less memory and storage requirements than previous MCMC schemes. We describe comparative simulation  results demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed MCMC algorithm against existing marginal and conditional MCMC samplers.  
Let f : {−1, 1}n → R be an n-variate polynomial consisting of 2n monomials,  in which only s  2n coefficients are non-zero. The goal is to learn the polynomial by querying the values of f . We introduce an active learning framework  that is associated with a low query cost and computational runtime. The significant savings are enabled by leveraging sampling strategies based on modern  coding theory, specifically, the design and analysis of sparse-graph codes, such  as Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, which represent the state-of-the-art  of modern packet communications. More significantly, we show how this design  perspective leads to exciting, and to the best of our knowledge, largely unexplored  intellectual connections between learning and coding.  The key is to relax the worst-case assumption with an ensemble-average setting,  where the polynomial is assumed to be drawn uniformly at random from the ensemble of all polynomials (of a given size n and sparsity s). Our framework succeeds with high probability with respect to the polynomial ensemble with sparsity  up to s = O(2δn ) for any δ ∈ (0, 1), where f is exactly learned using O(ns)  queries in time O(ns log s), even if the queries are perturbed by Gaussian noise.  We further apply the proposed framework to graph sketching, which is the problem of inferring sparse graphs by querying graph cuts. By writing the cut function  as a polynomial and exploiting the graph structure, we propose a sketching algorithm to learn the an arbitrary n-node unknown graph using only few cut queries,  which scales almost linearly in the number of edges and sub-linearly in the graph  size n. Experiments on real datasets show significant reductions in the runtime  and query complexity compared with competitive schemes.  
We propose a family of non-uniform sampling strategies to provably speed up  a class of stochastic optimization algorithms with linear convergence including  Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) and Stochastic Dual Coordinate  Ascent (SDCA). For a large family of penalized empirical risk minimization problems, our methods exploit data dependent local smoothness of the loss functions  near the optimum, while maintaining convergence guarantees. Our bounds are the  first to quantify the advantage gained from local smoothness which are significant  for some problems significantly better. Empirically, we provide thorough numerical results to back up our theory. Additionally we present algorithms exploiting  local smoothness in more aggressive ways, which perform even better in practice.  
In this paper we present a definition for visual saliency grounded in information  theory. This proposal is shown to relate to a variety of classic research contributions in scale-space theory, interest point detection, bilateral filtering, and to existing models of visual saliency. Based on the proposed definition of visual saliency,  we demonstrate results competitive with the state-of-the art for both prediction of  human fixations, and segmentation of salient objects. We also characterize different properties of this model including robustness to image transformations, and  extension to a wide range of other data types with 3D mesh models serving as an  example. Finally, we relate this proposal more generally to the role of saliency  computation in visual information processing and draw connections to putative  mechanisms for saliency computation in human vision.  
We provide a new analysis framework for the adversarial multi-armed bandit  problem. Using the notion of convex smoothing, we define a novel family of  algorithms with minimax optimal regret guarantees. First, we show that regularizationp  via the Tsallis entropy, which includes EXP3 as a special case, matches  the O( N T ) minimax regret with a smaller constant factor. Second, we show  that a p  wide class of perturbation methods achieve a near-optimal regret as low  as O( N T log N ), as long as the perturbation distribution has a bounded hazard function. For example, the Gumbel, Weibull, Frechet, Pareto, and Gamma  distributions all satisfy this key property and lead to near-optimal algorithms.  
We consider the problem of high-dimensional structured estimation with normregularized estimators, such as Lasso, when the design matrix and noise are drawn  from sub-exponential distributions. Existing results only consider sub-Gaussian  designs and noise, and both the sample complexity and non-asymptotic estimation  error have been shown to depend on the Gaussian width of suitable sets. In contrast, for the sub-exponential setting, we show that the sample complexity and the  estimation error will depend on the exponential width of the corresponding sets,  and the analysis holds for any norm. Further, using  √generic chaining, we show that  the exponential width for any set will be at most log p times the Gaussian width  of the set, yielding Gaussian width based results even for the sub-exponential case.  Further, for certain popular estimators, viz Lasso and Group Lasso, using a VCdimension based analysis, we show that the sample complexity will in fact be the  same order as Gaussian designs. Our general analysis and results are the first in  the sub-exponential setting, and are readily applicable to special sub-exponential  families such as log-concave and extreme-value distributions.  
Recent literature [1] suggests that embedding a graph on an unit sphere leads to  better generalization for graph transduction. However, the choice of optimal embedding and an efficient algorithm to compute the same remains open. In this  paper, we show that orthonormal representations, a class of unit-sphere graph embeddings are PAC learnable. Existing PAC-based analysis do not apply as the VC  dimension of the function class is infinite. We propose an alternative PAC-based  bound, which do not depend on the VC dimension of the underlying function  class, but is related to the famous Lovász ϑ function. The main contribution of the  paper is SPORE, a SPectral regularized ORthonormal Embedding for graph transduction, derived from the PAC bound. SPORE is posed as a non-smooth convex  function over an elliptope. These problems are usually solved as semi-definite programs (SDPs) with time complexity O(n6 ). We present, Infeasible Inexact proximal (IIP): an Inexact proximal method which performs subgradient procedure  on an approximate projection, not necessarily feasible. IIP is more scalable than  SDP, has an O( √1T ) convergence, and is generally applicable whenever a suitable approximate projection is available. We use IIP to compute SPORE where  the approximate projection step is computed by FISTA, an accelerated gradient  descent procedure. We show that the method has a convergence rate of O( √1T ).  The proposed algorithm easily scales to 1000’s of vertices, while the standard  SDP computation does not scale beyond few hundred vertices. Furthermore, the  analysis presented here easily extends to the multiple graph setting.  
We introduce a convolutional neural network that operates directly on graphs.  These networks allow end-to-end learning of prediction pipelines whose inputs  are graphs of arbitrary size and shape. The architecture we present generalizes  standard molecular feature extraction methods based on circular fingerprints. We  show that these data-driven features are more interpretable, and have better predictive performance on a variety of tasks.  
We investigate two novel mixed robust/average-case submodular data partitioning  problems that we collectively call Submodular Partitioning. These problems generalize purely robust instances of the problem, namely max-min submodular fair  allocation (SFA) [12] and min-max submodular load balancing (SLB) [25], and  also average-case instances, that is the submodular welfare problem (SWP) [26]  and submodular multiway partition (SMP) [5]. While the robust versions have been  studied in the theory community [11, 12, 16, 25, 26], existing work has focused  on tight approximation guarantees, and the resultant algorithms are not generally  scalable to large real-world applications. This is in contrast to the average case,  where most of the algorithms are scalable. In the present paper, we bridge this gap,  by proposing several new algorithms (including greedy, majorization-minimization,  minorization-maximization, and relaxation algorithms) that not only scale to large  datasets but that also achieve theoretical approximation guarantees comparable  to the state-of-the-art. We moreover provide new scalable algorithms that apply  to additive combinations of the robust and average-case objectives. We show that  these problems have many applications in machine learning (ML), including data  partitioning and load balancing for distributed ML, data clustering, and image segmentation. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on real-world  problems involving data partitioning for distributed optimization (of convex and  deep neural network objectives), and also purely unsupervised image segmentation.  
Tractable learning aims to learn probabilistic models where inference is guaranteed to be efficient. However, the particular class of queries that is tractable depends on the model and underlying representation. Usually this class is MPE  or conditional probabilities Pr(x|y) for joint assignments x, y. We propose a  tractable learner that guarantees efficient inference for a broader class of queries.  It simultaneously learns a Markov network and its tractable circuit representation,  in order to guarantee and measure tractability. Our approach differs from earlier  work by using Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDD) as the tractable language instead of Arithmetic Circuits (AC). SDDs have desirable properties, which more  general representations such as ACs lack, that enable basic primitives for Boolean  circuit compilation. This allows us to support a broader class of complex probability queries, including counting, threshold, and parity, in polytime.  
We present and analyze several strategies for improving the performance of  stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) methods. We first show that the  convergence rate of these methods can be preserved under a decreasing sequence  of errors in the control variate, and use this to derive variants of SVRG that use  growing-batch strategies to reduce the number of gradient calculations required  in the early iterations. We further (i) show how to exploit support vectors to reduce the number of gradient computations in the later iterations, (ii) prove that the  commonly–used regularized SVRG iteration is justified and improves the convergence rate, (iii) consider alternate mini-batch selection strategies, and (iv) consider  the generalization error of the method.  
We present the Mind the Gap Model (MGM), an approach for interpretable feature extraction and selection. By placing interpretability criteria directly into the  model, we allow for the model to both optimize parameters related to interpretability and to directly report a global set of distinguishable dimensions to assist with  further data exploration and hypothesis generation. MGM extracts distinguishing  features on real-world datasets of animal features, recipes ingredients, and disease co-occurrence. It also maintains or improves performance when compared  to related approaches. We perform a user study with domain experts to show the  MGM’s ability to help with dataset exploration.  
To make sense of the world our brains must analyze high-dimensional datasets  streamed by our sensory organs. Because such analysis begins with dimensionality reduction, modeling early sensory processing requires biologically plausible  online dimensionality reduction algorithms. Recently, we derived such an algorithm, termed similarity matching, from a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) objective function. However, in the existing algorithm, the number of output dimensions is set a priori by the number of output neurons and cannot be changed. Because the number of informative dimensions in sensory inputs is variable there is a  need for adaptive dimensionality reduction. Here, we derive biologically plausible  dimensionality reduction algorithms which adapt the number of output dimensions  to the eigenspectrum of the input covariance matrix. We formulate three objective  functions which, in the offline setting, are optimized by the projections of the input  dataset onto its principal subspace scaled by the eigenvalues of the output covariance matrix. In turn, the output eigenvalues are computed as i) soft-thresholded,  ii) hard-thresholded, iii) equalized thresholded eigenvalues of the input covariance matrix. In the online setting, we derive the three corresponding adaptive  algorithms and map them onto the dynamics of neuronal activity in networks with  biologically plausible local learning rules. Remarkably, in the last two networks,  neurons are divided into two classes which we identify with principal neurons and  interneurons in biological circuits.  
Recent advances in Bayesian learning with large-scale data have witnessed emergence of stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC), such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), stochastic gradient Hamiltonian MCMC  (SGHMC), and the stochastic gradient thermostat. While finite-time convergence  properties of the SGLD with a 1st-order Euler integrator have recently been studied, corresponding theory for general SG-MCMCs has not been explored. In this  paper we consider general SG-MCMCs with high-order integrators, and develop  theory to analyze finite-time convergence properties and their asymptotic invariant  measures. Our theoretical results show faster convergence rates and more accurate invariant measures for SG-MCMCs with higher-order integrators. For example, with the proposed efficient 2nd-order symmetric splitting integrator, the mean  square error (MSE) of the posterior average for the SGHMC achieves an optimal  convergence rate of L−4/5 at L iterations, compared to L−2/3 for the SGHMC  and SGLD with 1st-order Euler integrators. Furthermore, convergence results of  decreasing-step-size SG-MCMCs are also developed, with the same convergence  rates as their fixed-step-size counterparts for a specific decreasing sequence. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify our theory, and show advantages of the proposed method in two large-scale real applications.  
Learning the structure of a probabilistic graphical models is a well studied problem in the machine learning community due to its importance in many applications. Current approaches are mainly focused on learning the structure under restrictive parametric assumptions, which limits the applicability of these methods.  In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the structure of a probabilistic  graphical model without assuming a particular parametric model. We consider  probabilities that are members of an infinite dimensional exponential family [4],  which is parametrized by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H and its  kernel k. One difficulty in learning nonparametric densities is the evaluation of  the normalizing constant. In order to avoid this issue, our procedure minimizes  the penalized score matching objective [10, 11]. We show how to efficiently minimize the proposed objective using existing group lasso solvers. Furthermore, we  prove that our procedure recovers the graph structure with high-probability under  mild conditions. Simulation studies illustrate ability of our procedure to recover  the true graph structure without the knowledge of the data generating process.  
In this paper, we present the mQA model, which is able to answer questions about  the content of an image. The answer can be a sentence, a phrase or a single word.  Our model contains four components: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to  extract the question representation, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to  extract the visual representation, an LSTM for storing the linguistic context in an  answer, and a fusing component to combine the information from the first three  components and generate the answer. We construct a Freestyle Multilingual Image Question Answering (FM-IQA) dataset to train and evaluate our mQA model.  It contains over 150,000 images and 310,000 freestyle Chinese question-answer  pairs and their English translations. The quality of the generated answers of our  mQA model on this dataset is evaluated by human judges through a Turing Test.  Specifically, we mix the answers provided by humans and our model. The human  judges need to distinguish our model from the human. They will also provide  a score (i.e. 0, 1, 2, the larger the better) indicating the quality of the answer.  We propose strategies to monitor the quality of this evaluation process. The experiments show that in 64.7% of cases, the human judges cannot distinguish our  model from humans. The average score is 1.454 (1.918 for human). The details  of this work, including the FM-IQA dataset, can be found on the project page:  http://idl.baidu.com/FM-IQA.html.  
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a workhorse in machine learning, yet its  slow convergence can be a computational bottleneck. Variance reduction techniques such as SAG, SVRG and SAGA have been proposed to overcome this  weakness, achieving linear convergence. However, these methods are either based  on computations of full gradients at pivot points, or on keeping per data point corrections in memory. Therefore speed-ups relative to SGD may need a minimal  number of epochs in order to materialize. This paper investigates algorithms that  can exploit neighborhood structure in the training data to share and re-use information about past stochastic gradients across data points, which offers advantages  in the transient optimization phase. As a side-product we provide a unified convergence analysis for a family of variance reduction algorithms, which we call  memorization algorithms. We provide experimental results supporting our theory.    
We present a data-driven optimal control framework that is derived using the path  integral (PI) control approach. We find iterative control laws analytically without a  priori policy parameterization based on probabilistic representation of the learned  dynamics model. The proposed algorithm operates in a forward-backward manner  which differentiate it from other PI-related methods that perform forward sampling to find optimal controls. Our method uses significantly less samples to find  analytic control laws compared to other approaches within the PI control family  that rely on extensive sampling from given dynamics models or trials on physical  systems in a model-free fashion. In addition, the learned controllers can be generalized to new tasks without re-sampling based on the compositionality theory for  the linearly-solvable optimal control framework. We provide experimental results  on three different tasks and comparisons with state-of-the-art model-based methods to demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of the proposed framework.  
Expectation propagation (EP) is a deterministic approximation algorithm that is  often used to perform approximate Bayesian parameter learning. EP approximates  the full intractable posterior distribution through a set of local approximations that  are iteratively refined for each datapoint. EP can offer analytic and computational  advantages over other approximations, such as Variational Inference (VI), and is  the method of choice for a number of models. The local nature of EP appears to  make it an ideal candidate for performing Bayesian learning on large models in  large-scale dataset settings. However, EP has a crucial limitation in this context:  the number of approximating factors needs to increase with the number of datapoints, N , which often entails a prohibitively large memory overhead. This paper  presents an extension to EP, called stochastic expectation propagation (SEP), that  maintains a global posterior approximation (like VI) but updates it in a local way  (like EP). Experiments on a number of canonical learning problems using synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that SEP performs almost as well as full  EP, but reduces the memory consumption by a factor of N . SEP is therefore ideally suited to performing approximate Bayesian learning in the large model, large  dataset setting.  
Computing the MAP assignment in graphical models is generally intractable. As a  result, for discrete graphical models, the MAP problem is often approximated using linear programming relaxations. Much research has focused on characterizing  when these LP relaxations are tight, and while they are relatively well-understood  in the discrete case, only a few results are known for their continuous analog.  In this work, we use graph covers to provide necessary and sufficient conditions  for continuous MAP relaxations to be tight. We use this characterization to give  simple proofs that the relaxation is tight for log-concave decomposable and logsupermodular decomposable models. We conclude by exploring the relationship  between these two seemingly distinct classes of functions and providing specific  conditions under which the MAP relaxation can and cannot be tight.  
Nonlinear component analysis such as kernel Principle Component Analysis  (KPCA) and kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) are widely used in  machine learning, statistics and data analysis, but they cannot scale up to big  datasets. Recent attempts have employed random feature approximations to convert the problem to the primal form for linear computational complexity. However, to obtain high quality solutions, the number of random features should be  the same order of magnitude as the number of data points, making such approach  not directly applicable to the regime with millions of data points.  We propose a simple, computationally efficient, and memory friendly algorithm  based on the “doubly stochastic gradients” to scale up a range of kernel nonlinear  component analysis, such as kernel PCA, CCA and SVD. Despite the non-convex  nature of these problems, our method enjoys theoretical guarantees that it converges at the rate Õ(1/t) to the global optimum, even for the top k eigen subspace.  Unlike many alternatives, our algorithm does not require explicit orthogonalization, which is infeasible on big datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness and  scalability of our algorithm on large scale synthetic and real world datasets.    
Overfitting is the bane of data analysts, even when data are plentiful. Formal  approaches to understanding this problem focus on statistical inference and generalization of individual analysis procedures. Yet the practice of data analysis is  an inherently interactive and adaptive process: new analyses and hypotheses are  proposed after seeing the results of previous ones, parameters are tuned on the  basis of obtained results, and datasets are shared and reused. An investigation of  this gap has recently been initiated by the authors in [7], where we focused on the  problem of estimating expectations of adaptively chosen functions.  In this paper, we give a simple and practical method for reusing a holdout (or  testing) set to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning algorithm  operating on a training set. Reusing a holdout set adaptively multiple times can  easily lead to overfitting to the holdout set itself. We give an algorithm that enables  the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses, while provably  avoiding overfitting. We illustrate the advantages of our algorithm over the standard  use of the holdout set via a simple synthetic experiment.  We also formalize and address the general problem of data reuse in adaptive data  analysis. We show how the differential-privacy based approach given in [7] is  applicable much more broadly to adaptive data analysis. We then show that a  simple approach based on description length can also be used to give guarantees of  statistical validity in adaptive settings. Finally, we demonstrate that these incomparable approaches can be unified via the notion of approximate max-information  that we introduce. This, in particular, allows the preservation of statistical validity guarantees even when an analyst adaptively composes algorithms which have  guarantees based on either of the two approaches.  
A market scoring rule (MSR) – a popular tool for designing algorithmic prediction  markets – is an incentive-compatible mechanism for the aggregation of probabilistic beliefs from myopic risk-neutral agents. In this paper, we add to a growing  body of research aimed at understanding the precise manner in which the price  process induced by a MSR incorporates private information from agents who deviate from the assumption of risk-neutrality. We first establish that, for a myopic  trading agent with a risk-averse utility function, a MSR satisfying mild regularity conditions elicits the agent’s risk-neutral probability conditional on the latest  market state rather than her true subjective probability. Hence, we show that a  MSR under these conditions effectively behaves like a more traditional method of  belief aggregation, namely an opinion pool, for agents’ true probabilities. In particular, the logarithmic market scoring rule acts as a logarithmic pool for constant  absolute risk aversion utility agents, and as a linear pool for an atypical budgetconstrained agent utility with decreasing absolute risk aversion. We also point out  the interpretation of a market maker under these conditions as a Bayesian learner  even when agent beliefs are static.  
Over the past decades, Linear Programming (LP) has been widely used in different  areas and considered as one of the mature technologies in numerical optimization.  However, the complexity offered by state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e. interior-point  method and primal, dual simplex methods) is still unsatisfactory for problems in  machine learning with huge number of variables and constraints. In this paper,  we investigate a general LP algorithm based on the combination of Augmented  Lagrangian and Coordinate Descent (AL-CD), giving an iteration complexity of  O((log(1/))2 ) with O(nnz(A)) cost per iteration, where nnz(A) is the number  of non-zeros in the m × n constraint matrix A, and in practice, one can further reduce cost per iteration to the order of non-zeros in columns (rows) corresponding  to the active primal (dual) variables through an active-set strategy. The algorithm  thus yields a tractable alternative to standard LP methods for large-scale problems  of sparse solutions and nnz(A)  mn. We conduct experiments on large-scale  LP instances from `1 -regularized multi-class SVM, Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation, and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, where the proposed approach  finds solutions of 10−3 precision orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art  implementations of interior-point and simplex methods. 1  
Theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that the depth of neural networks  is crucial for their success. However, training becomes more difficult as depth  increases, and training of very deep networks remains an open problem. Here we  introduce a new architecture designed to overcome this. Our so-called highway  networks allow unimpeded information flow across many layers on information  highways. They are inspired by Long Short-Term Memory recurrent networks and  use adaptive gating units to regulate the information flow. Even with hundreds of  layers, highway networks can be trained directly through simple gradient descent.  This enables the study of extremely deep and efficient architectures.  
We introduce a novel information-theoretic approach for active model selection  and demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world application. Although our method  can work with arbitrary models, we focus on actively learning the appropriate  structure for Gaussian process (GP) models with arbitrary observation likelihoods.  We then apply this framework to rapid screening for noise-induced hearing loss  (NIHL), a widespread and preventible disability, if diagnosed early. We construct a  GP model for pure-tone audiometric responses of patients with NIHL . Using this  and a previously published model for healthy responses, the proposed method is  shown to be capable of diagnosing the presence or absence of NIHL with drastically  fewer samples than existing approaches. Further, the method is extremely fast and  enables the diagnosis to be performed in real time.  
Infinite Hidden Markov Models (iHMM’s) are an attractive, nonparametric generalization of the classical Hidden Markov Model which can automatically infer the  number of hidden states in the system. However, due to the infinite-dimensional  nature of the transition dynamics, performing inference in the iHMM is difficult.  In this paper, we present an infinite-state Particle Gibbs (PG) algorithm to resample state trajectories for the iHMM. The proposed algorithm uses an efficient  proposal optimized for iHMMs and leverages ancestor sampling to improve the  mixing of the standard PG algorithm. Our algorithm demonstrates significant convergence improvements on synthetic and real world data sets.  
We propose a Bayesian mixed-effects model to learn typical scenarios of changes  from longitudinal manifold-valued data, namely repeated measurements of the  same objects or individuals at several points in time. The model allows to estimate  a group-average trajectory in the space of measurements. Random variations of  this trajectory result from spatiotemporal transformations, which allow changes in  the direction of the trajectory and in the pace at which trajectories are followed.  The use of the tools of Riemannian geometry allows to derive a generic algorithm  for any kind of data with smooth constraints, which lie therefore on a Riemannian  manifold. Stochastic approximations of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm  is used to estimate the model parameters in this highly non-linear setting. The  method is used to estimate a data-driven model of the progressive impairments of  cognitive functions during the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Experimental results  show that the model correctly put into correspondence the age at which each individual was diagnosed with the disease, thus validating the fact that it effectively  estimated a normative scenario of disease progression. Random effects provide  unique insights into the variations in the ordering and timing of the succession of  cognitive impairments across different individuals.  
The degree of confidence in one’s choice or decision is a critical aspect of perceptual decision making. Attempts to quantify a decision maker’s confidence by  measuring accuracy in a task have yielded limited success because confidence and  accuracy are typically not equal. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian framework  to model confidence in perceptual decision making. We show that this model,  based on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), is able to  predict confidence of a decision maker based only on the data available to the  experimenter. We test our model on two experiments on confidence-based decision making involving the well-known random dots motion discrimination task.  In both experiments, we show that our model’s predictions closely match experimental data. Additionally, our model is also consistent with other phenomena  such as the hard-easy effect in perceptual decision making.    
We revisit the choice of SGD for training deep neural networks by reconsidering  the appropriate geometry in which to optimize the weights. We argue for a geometry invariant to rescaling of weights that does not affect the output of the network,  and suggest Path-SGD, which is an approximate steepest descent method with respect to a path-wise regularizer related to max-norm regularization. Path-SGD is  easy and efficient to implement and leads to empirical gains over SGD and AdaGrad.  
Variable screening is a fast dimension reduction technique for assisting high dimensional feature selection. As a preselection method, it selects a moderate size  subset of candidate variables for further refining via feature selection to produce  the final model. The performance of variable screening depends on both computational efficiency and the ability to dramatically reduce the number of variables  without discarding the important ones. When the data dimension p is substantially  larger than the sample size n, variable screening becomes crucial as 1) Faster feature selection algorithms are needed; 2) Conditions guaranteeing selection consistency might fail to hold. This article studies a class of linear screening methods  and establishes consistency theory for this special class. In particular, we prove  the restricted diagonally dominant (RDD) condition is a necessary and sufficient  condition for strong screening consistency. As concrete examples, we show two  screening methods SIS and HOLP are both strong screening consistent (subject  to additional constraints) with large probability if n > O((ρs+σ/τ )2 log p) under  random designs. In addition, we relate the RDD condition to the irrepresentable  condition, and highlight limitations of SIS.  
We introduce a neural network with a recurrent attention model over a possibly  large external memory. The architecture is a form of Memory Network [23]  but unlike the model in that work, it is trained end-to-end, and hence requires  significantly less supervision during training, making it more generally applicable  in realistic settings. It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch [2] to the  case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol.  The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic)  question answering [22] and to language modeling. For the former our approach  is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter,  on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable  performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept  of multiple computational hops yields improved results.  
Discrete Fourier transforms provide a significant speedup in the computation of  convolutions in deep learning. In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond its advantages for efficient computation, the spectral domain also provides a powerful  representation in which to model and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  We employ spectral representations to introduce a number of innovations to CNN  design. First, we propose spectral pooling, which performs dimensionality reduction by truncating the representation in the frequency domain. This approach  preserves considerably more information per parameter than other pooling strategies and enables flexibility in the choice of pooling output dimensionality. This  representation also enables a new form of stochastic regularization by randomized modification of resolution. We show that these methods achieve competitive  results on classification and approximation tasks, without using any dropout or  max-pooling.  Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of complex-coefficient spectral parameterization of convolutional filters. While this leaves the underlying model unchanged, it results in a representation that greatly facilitates optimization. We  observe on a variety of popular CNN configurations that this leads to significantly  faster convergence during training.  
We extend the theory of boosting for regression problems to the online  learning setting. Generalizing from the batch setting for boosting, the notion of a weak learning algorithm is modeled as an online learning algorithm  with linear loss functions that competes with a base class of regression functions, while a strong learning algorithm is an online learning algorithm with  smooth convex loss functions that competes with a larger class of regression functions. Our main result is an online gradient boosting algorithm  that converts a weak online learning algorithm into a strong one where the  larger class of functions is the linear span of the base class. We also give a  simpler boosting algorithm that converts a weak online learning algorithm  into a strong one where the larger class of functions is the convex hull of  the base class, and prove its optimality.  
Deep dynamic generative models are developed to learn sequential dependencies  in time-series data. The multi-layered model is designed by constructing a hierarchy of temporal sigmoid belief networks (TSBNs), defined as a sequential stack  of sigmoid belief networks (SBNs). Each SBN has a contextual hidden state,  inherited from the previous SBNs in the sequence, and is used to regulate its hidden bias. Scalable learning and inference algorithms are derived by introducing  a recognition model that yields fast sampling from the variational posterior. This  recognition model is trained jointly with the generative model, by maximizing its  variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Experimental results on bouncing  balls, polyphonic music, motion capture, and text streams show that the proposed  approach achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, and has the capacity to  synthesize various sequences.  
Many neural circuits are composed of numerous distinct cell types that perform  different operations on their inputs, and send their outputs to distinct targets.  Therefore, a key step in understanding neural systems is to reliably distinguish  cell types. An important example is the retina, for which present-day techniques  for identifying cell types are accurate, but very labor-intensive. Here, we develop  automated classifiers for functional identification of retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, based solely on recorded voltage patterns on a large  scale array. We use per-cell classifiers based on features extracted from electrophysiological images (spatiotemporal voltage waveforms) and interspike intervals  (autocorrelations). These classifiers achieve high performance in distinguishing  between the major ganglion cell classes of the primate retina, but fail in achieving the same accuracy in predicting cell polarities (ON vs. OFF). We then show  how to use indicators of functional coupling within populations of ganglion cells  (cross-correlation) to infer cell polarities with a matrix completion algorithm. This  can result in accurate, fully automated methods for cell type classification.  
The dynamics of simple decisions are well understood and modeled as a class  of random walk models [e.g. 1–4]. However, most real-life decisions include a  dynamically-changing influence of additional information we call context. In this  work, we describe a computational theory of decision making under dynamically  shifting context. We show how the model generalizes the dominant existing model  of fixed-context decision making [2] and can be built up from a weighted combination of fixed-context decisions evolving simultaneously. We also show how the  model generalizes recent work on the control of attention in the Flanker task [5].  Finally, we show how the model recovers qualitative data patterns in another task  of longstanding psychological interest, the AX Continuous Performance Test [6],  using the same model parameters.  
We propose a method for combining two sources of astronomical data, spectroscopy and photometry, that carry information about sources of light (e.g., stars,  galaxies, and quasars) at extremely different spectral resolutions. Our model treats  the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the radiation from a source as a latent  variable that jointly explains both photometric and spectroscopic observations.  We place a flexible, nonparametric prior over the SED of a light source that admits a physically interpretable decomposition, and allows us to tractably perform  inference. We use our model to predict the distribution of the redshift of a quasar  from five-band (low spectral resolution) photometric data, the so called “photoz” problem. Our method shows that tools from machine learning and Bayesian  statistics allow us to leverage multiple resolutions of information to make accurate predictions with well-characterized uncertainties.  
Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building useful complex prediction systems quickly. This paper argues it is dangerous to think of  these quick wins as coming for free. Using the software engineering framework  of technical debt, we find it is common to incur massive ongoing maintenance  costs in real-world ML systems. We explore several ML-specific risk factors to  account for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement,  hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, configuration  issues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.  
abstractions to the state of database technology [17], making the point that nothing in the machine  learning literature comes close to the success of the relational database as a basic abstraction. What  is the right interface to describe a stream of data, or a model, or a prediction?  For distributed learning in particular, there remains a lack of widely accepted abstractions. It could  be argued that the widespread use of Map-Reduce in machine learning was driven by the void of  strong distributed learning abstractions. Indeed, one of the few areas of broad agreement in recent  years appears to be that Map-Reduce is a poor abstraction for iterative ML algorithms.  
 We focus on the discovery and identification of direct causes and effects of a target  variable in a causal network. State-of-the-art causal learning algorithms generally  need to find the global causal structures in the form of complete partial directed  acyclic graphs (CPDAG) in order to identify direct causes and effects of a target  variable. While these algorithms are effective, it is often unnecessary and wasteful  to find the global structures when we are only interested in the local structure of  one target variable (such as class labels). We propose a new local causal discovery algorithm, called Causal Markov Blanket (CMB), to identify the direct causes  and effects of a target variable based on Markov Blanket Discovery. CMB is designed to conduct causal discovery among multiple variables, but focuses only on  finding causal relationships between a specific target variable and other variables.  Under standard assumptions, we show both theoretically and experimentally that  the proposed local causal discovery algorithm can obtain the comparable identification accuracy as global methods but significantly improve their efficiency, often  by more than one order of magnitude.  
We provide a general theory of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for  inferring high dimensional latent variable models. In particular, we make two contributions: (i) For parameter estimation, we propose a novel high dimensional EM  algorithm which naturally incorporates sparsity structure into parameter estimation.  With an appropriate initialization, this algorithm converges at a geometric rate  and attains an estimator with the (near-)optimal statistical rate of convergence. (ii)  Based on the obtained estimator, we propose a new inferential procedure for testing  hypotheses for low dimensional components of high dimensional parameters. For  a broad family of statistical models, our framework establishes the first computationally feasible approach for optimal estimation and asymptotic inference in high  dimensions.  
We present a revenue optimization algorithm for posted-price auctions when facing a buyer with random valuations who seeks to optimize his -discounted surplus. In order to analyze this problem we introduce the notion of ✏-strategic buyer,  a more natural notion of strategic behavior than what has been considered in the  past. We improve upon the previous state-of-the-art and achieve an optimal regret  bound in O(log T + 1/ log(1/ ))pwhen the seller selects prices from a finite set  e T + T 1/4 / log(1/ )) when the prices offered  and provide a regret bound in O(  are selected out of the interval [0, 1].  
This paper presents the Deep Convolution Inverse Graphics Network (DCIGN), a model that aims to learn an interpretable representation of images,  disentangled with respect to three-dimensional scene structure and viewing  transformations such as depth rotations and lighting variations. The DCIGN model is composed of multiple layers of convolution and de-convolution  operators and is trained using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes  (SGVB) algorithm [10]. We propose a training procedure to encourage  neurons in the graphics code layer to represent a specific transformation  (e.g. pose or light). Given a single input image, our model can generate  new images of the same object with variations in pose and lighting. We  present qualitative and quantitative tests of the model’s efficacy at learning  a 3D rendering engine for varied object classes including faces and chairs.  
Motivated by the problem of robust factorization of a low-rank tensor, we study the question of sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition. We present an efficient computational algorithm that modifies Leurgans’ algoirthm for tensor factorization. Our method relies on a reduction of the problem to sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition via the notion of tensor contraction. We use well-understood convex techniques for solving the reduced matrix sub-problem which then allows us to perform the full decomposition of the tensor. We delineate situations where the problem is recoverable and provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithm. We validate our algorithm with numerical experiments.  
We consider an adversarial formulation of the problem of predicting a time series with square loss. The aim is to predict an arbitrary sequence of vectors almost as well as the best smooth comparator sequence in retrospect. Our approach allows natural measures of smoothness such as the squared norm of increments. More generally, we consider a linear time series model and penalize the comparator sequence through the energy of the implied driving noise terms. We derive the minimax strategy for all problems of this type and show that it can be implemented efficiently. The optimal predictions are linear in the previous observations. We obtain an explicit expression for the regret in terms of the parameters defining the problem. For typical, simple definitions of smoothness, the computation of the optimal predictions involves only sparse matrices. In the case of norm-constrained data, where the smoothness is defined in terms of the squared √ norm of the comparator’s increments, we show that the regret grows as T / λT , where T is the length of the game and λT is an increasing limit on comparator smoothness.  
We investigate the problem of learning an unknown probability distribution over a discrete population from random samples. Our goal is to design efficient algorithms that simultaneously achieve low error in total variation norm while guaranteeing Differential Privacy to the individuals of the population. We describe a general approach that yields near sample-optimal and computationally efficient differentially private estimators for a wide range of well-studied and natural distribution families. Our theoretical results show that for a wide variety of structured distributions there exist private estimation algorithms that are nearly as efficient—both in terms of sample size and running time—as their non-private counterparts. We complement our theoretical guarantees with an experimental evaluation. Our experiments illustrate the speed and accuracy of our private estimators on both synthetic mixture models and a large public data set.  
Metric learning seeks a transformation of the feature space that enhances prediction quality for a given task. In this work we provide PAC-style sample complexity rates for supervised metric learning. We give matching lower- and upper-bounds showing that sample complexity scales with the representation dimension when no assumptions are made about the underlying data distribution. In addition, by leveraging the structure of the data distribution, we provide rates fine-tuned to a specific notion of the intrinsic complexity of a given dataset, allowing us to relax the dependence on representation dimension. We show both theoretically and empirically that augmenting the metric learning optimization criterion with a simple norm-based regularization is important and can help adapt to a dataset’s intrinsic complexity yielding better generalization, thus partly explaining the empirical success of similar regularizations reported in previous works.  
Despite their success, convolutional neural networks are computationally expensive because they must examine all image locations. Stochastic attention-based models have been shown to improve computational efficiency at test time, but they remain difficult to train because of intractable posterior inference and high variance in the stochastic gradient estimates. Borrowing techniques from the literature on training deep generative models, we present the Wake-Sleep Recurrent Attention Model, a method for training stochastic attention networks which improves posterior inference and which reduces the variability in the stochastic gradients. We show that our method can greatly speed up the training time for stochastic attention networks in the domains of image classification and caption generation.  
Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are popular tools for studying network structures. However, many modern applications such as gene network discovery and social interactions analysis often involve high-dimensional noisy data with outliers or heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose the Trimmed Graphical Lasso for robust estimation of sparse GGMs. Our method guards against outliers by an implicit trimming mechanism akin to the popular Least Trimmed Squares method used for linear regression. We provide a rigorous statistical analysis of our estimator in the high-dimensional setting. In contrast, existing approaches for robust sparse GGMs estimation lack statistical guarantees. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments on simulated and real gene expression data which further demonstrate the value of our approach.  
We consider the problem of testing whether two unequal-sized samples were drawn from identical distributions, versus distributions that differ significantly. Specifically, given a target error parameter ε > 0, m1 independent draws from an unknown distribution p with discrete support, and m2 draws from an unknown distribution q of discrete support, we describe a test for distinguishing the case that p = q from the case that ||p − q||1 ≥ ε. If p and q are supported on at most n elements, then our with high probability provided m1 ≥ n2/3 /ε4/3  test is successful
The Jaccard index is a standard statistics for comparing the pairwise similarity between data samples. This paper investigates the problem of estimating a Jaccard index matrix when there are missing observations in data samples. Starting from a Jaccard index matrix approximated from the incomplete data, our method calibrates the matrix to meet the requirement of positive semi-definiteness and other constraints, through a simple alternating projection algorithm. Compared with conventional approaches that estimate the similarity matrix based on the imputed data, our method has a strong advantage in that the calibrated matrix is guaranteed to be closer to the unknown ground truth in the Frobenius norm than the un-calibrated matrix (except in special cases they are identical). We carried out a series of empirical experiments and the results confirmed our theoretical justification. The evaluation also reported significantly improved results in real learning tasks on benchmark datasets.  
Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), or particle filtering, is a popular class of methods for sampling from an intractable target distribution using a sequence of simpler intermediate distributions. Like other importance sampling-based methods, performance is critically dependent on the proposal distribution: a bad proposal can lead to arbitrarily inaccurate estimates of the target distribution. This paper presents a new method for automatically adapting the proposal using an approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior and the proposal distribution. The method is very flexible, applicable to any parameterized proposal distribution and it supports online and batch variants. We use the new framework to adapt powerful proposal distributions with rich parameterizations based upon neural networks leading to Neural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (NASMC). Experiments indicate that NASMC significantly improves inference in a non-linear state space model outperforming adaptive proposal methods including the Extended Kalman and Unscented Particle Filters. Experiments also indicate that improved inference translates into improved parameter learning when NASMC is used as a subroutine of Particle Marginal Metropolis Hastings. Finally we show that NASMC is able to train a latent variable recurrent neural network (LV-RNN) achieving results that compete with the state-of-the-art for polymorphic music modelling. NASMC can be seen as bridging the gap between adaptive SMC methods and the recent work in scalable, black-box variational inference.  
We introduce local expectation gradients which is a general purpose stochastic variational inference algorithm for constructing stochastic gradients by sampling from the variational distribution. This algorithm divides the problem of estimating the stochastic gradients over multiple variational parameters into smaller sub-tasks so that each sub-task explores intelligently the most relevant part of the variational distribution. This is achieved by performing an exact expectation over the single random variable that most correlates with the variational parameter of interest resulting in a Rao-Blackwellized estimate that has low variance. Our method works efficiently for both continuous and discrete random variables. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has interesting similarities with Gibbs sampling but at the same time, unlike Gibbs sampling, can be trivially parallelized.  
We study optimization algorithms based on variance reduction for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Remarkable recent progress has been made in this direction through development of algorithms like SAG, SVRG, SAGA. These algorithms have been shown to outperform SGD, both theoretically and empirically. However, asynchronous versions of these algorithms—a crucial requirement for modern large-scale applications—have not been studied. We bridge this gap by presenting a unifying framework for many variance reduction techniques. Subsequently, we propose an asynchronous algorithm grounded in our framework, and prove its fast convergence. An important consequence of our general approach is that it yields asynchronous versions of variance reduction algorithms such as SVRG and SAGA as a byproduct. Our method achieves near linear speedup in sparse settings common to machine learning. We demonstrate the empirical performance of our method through a concrete realization of asynchronous SVRG.  
Active learning methods automatically adapt data collection by selecting the most informative samples in order to accelerate machine learning. Because of this, real-world testing and comparing active learning algorithms requires collecting new datasets (adaptively), rather than simply applying algorithms to benchmark datasets, as is the norm in (passive) machine learning research. To facilitate the development, testing and deployment of active learning for real applications, we have built an open-source software system for large-scale active learning research and experimentation. The system, called NEXT, provides a unique platform for real-world, reproducible active learning research. This paper details the challenges of building the system and demonstrates its capabilities with several experiments. The results show how experimentation can help expose strengths and weaknesses of active learning algorithms, in sometimes unexpected and enlightening ways.  
Super-resolution is the problem of recovering a superposition of point sources using bandlimited measurements, which may be corrupted with noise. This signal processing problem arises in numerous imaging problems, ranging from astronomy to biology to spectroscopy, where it is common to take (coarse) Fourier measurements of an object. Of particular interest is in obtaining estimation procedures which are robust to noise, with the following desirable statistical and computational properties: we seek to use coarse Fourier measurements (bounded by some cutoff frequency); we hope to take a (quantifiably) small number of measurements; we desire our algorithm to run quickly. Suppose we have k point sources in d dimensions, where the points are separated by at least from each other (in Euclidean distance). This work provides an algorithm with the following favorable guarantees: • The algorithm uses Fourier measurements, whose frequencies are bounded by O(1/ ) (up to log factors). p Previous algorithms require a cutoff frequency which may be as large as ⌦( d/ ). • The number of measurements taken by and the computational complexity of our algorithm are bounded by a polynomial in both the number of points k and the dimension d, with no dependence on the separation . In contrast, previous algorithms depended inverse polynomially on the minimal separation and exponentially on the dimension for both of these quantities. Our estimation procedure itself is simple: we take random bandlimited measurements (as opposed to taking an exponential number of measurements on the hypergrid). Furthermore, our analysis and algorithm are elementary (based on concentration bounds for sampling and the singular value decomposition).  
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a ubiquitous algorithm for a variety of machine learning problems. Researchers and industry have developed several techniques to optimize SGD’s runtime performance, including asynchronous execution and reduced precision. Our main result is a martingale-based analysis that enables us to capture the rich noise models that may arise from such techniques. Specifically, we use our new analysis in three ways: (1) we derive convergence rates for the convex case (H OGWILD !) with relaxed assumptions on the sparsity of the problem; (2) we analyze asynchronous SGD algorithms for non-convex matrix problems including matrix completion; and (3) we design and analyze an asynchronous SGD algorithm, called B UCKWILD !, that uses lower-precision arithmetic. We show experimentally that our algorithms run efficiently for a variety of problems on modern hardware.  
In recent years, approaches based on machine learning have achieved state-of-the art performance on image restoration problems. Successful approaches include both generative models of natural images as well as discriminative training of deep neural networks. Discriminative training of feed forward architectures allows explicit control over the computational cost of performing restoration and therefore often leads to better performance at the same cost at run time. In contrast, generative models have the advantage that they can be trained once and then adapted to any image restoration task by a simple use of Bayes’ rule. In this paper we show how to combine the strengths of both approaches by training a discriminative, feed-forward architecture to predict the state of latent variables in a generative model of natural images. We apply this idea to the very successful Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of natural images. We show that it is possible to achieve comparable performance as the original GMM but with two orders of magnitude improvement in run time while maintaining the advantage of generative models.  
We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that are discrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence. Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence [1] and Neural Turing Machines [2], because the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems – finding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem – using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete problems.  
An associative memory is a structure learned from a dataset M of vectors (signals) in a way such that, given a noisy version of one of the vectors as input, the nearest valid vector from M (nearest neighbor) is provided as output, preferably via a fast iterative algorithm. Traditionally, binary (or q-ary) Hopfield neural networks are used to model the above structure. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a model of associative memory based on sparse recovery of signals. Our basic premise is simple. For a dataset, we learn a set of linear constraints that every vector in the dataset must satisfy. Provided these linear constraints possess some special properties, it is possible to cast the task of finding nearest neighbor as a sparse recovery problem. Assuming generic random models for the dataset, we show that it is possible to store super-polynomial or exponential number of n-length vectors in a neural network of size O(n). Furthermore, given a noisy version of one of the stored vectors corrupted in near-linear number of coordinates, the vector can be correctly recalled using a neurally feasible algorithm.  
Spectral inference provides fast algorithms and provable optimality for latent topic analysis. But for real data these algorithms require additional ad-hoc heuristics, and even then often produce unusable results. We explain this poor performance by casting the problem of topic inference in the framework of Joint Stochastic Matrix Factorization (JSMF) and showing that previous methods violate the theoretical conditions necessary for a good solution to exist. We then propose a novel rectification method that learns high quality topics and their interactions even on small, noisy data. This method achieves results comparable to probabilistic techniques in several domains while maintaining scalability and provable optimality. Given a directed acyclic graph G, and a set of values y on the vertices, the Isotonic Regression of y is a vector x that respects the partial order described by G, and minimizes kx − yk , for a specified norm. This paper gives improved algorithms for computing the Isotonic Regression for all weighted `p -norms with rigorous performance guarantees. Our algorithms are quite practical, and variants of them can be implemented to run fast in practice.  
Multivariate loss functions are used to assess performance in many modern prediction tasks, including information retrieval and ranking applications. Convex approximations are typically optimized in their place to avoid NP-hard empirical risk minimization problems. We propose to approximate the training data instead of the loss function by posing multivariate prediction as an adversarial game between a loss-minimizing prediction player and a loss-maximizing evaluation player constrained to match specified properties of training data. This avoids the non-convexity of empirical risk minimization, but game sizes are exponential in the number of predicted variables. We overcome this intractability using the double oracle constraint generation method. We demonstrate the efficiency and predictive performance of our approach on tasks evaluated using the precision at k, the F-score and the discounted cumulative gain.  
Asynchronous parallel implementations of stochastic gradient (SG) have been broadly used in solving deep neural network and received many successes in practice recently. However, existing theories cannot explain their convergence and speedup properties, mainly due to the nonconvexity of most deep learning formulations and the asynchronous parallel mechanism. To fill the gaps in theory and provide theoretical supports, this paper studies two asynchronous parallel implementations of SG: one is over a computer network and the other √ is on a shared memory system. We establish an ergodic convergence rate O(1/ K) for both algorithms and prove √ that the linear speedup is achievable if the number of workers is bounded by K (K is the total number of iterations). Our results generalize and improve existing analysis for convex minimization.  
We introduce Embed to Control (E2C), a method for model learning and control of non-linear dynamical systems from raw pixel images. E2C consists of a deep generative model, belonging to the family of variational autoencoders, that learns to generate image trajectories from a latent space in which the dynamics is constrained to be locally linear. Our model is derived directly from an optimal control formulation in latent space, supports long-term prediction of image sequences and exhibits strong performance on a variety of complex control problems.  
We develop a new active learning algorithm for the streaming setting satisfying three important properties: 1) It provably works for any classifier representation and classification problem including those with severe noise. 2) It is efficiently implementable with an ERM oracle. 3) It is more aggressive than all previous approaches satisfying 1 and 2. To do this, we create an algorithm based on a newly defined optimization problem and analyze it. We also conduct the first experimental analysis of all efficient agnostic active learning algorithms, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses in different settings.  
Recent machine learning methods for sequential behavior prediction estimate the motives of behavior rather than the behavior itself. This higher-level abstraction improves generalization in different prediction settings, but computing predictions often becomes intractable in large decision spaces. We propose the Softstar algorithm, a softened heuristic-guided search technique for the maximum entropy inverse optimal control model of sequential behavior. This approach supports probabilistic search with bounded approximation error at a significantly reduced computational cost when compared to sampling based methods. We present the algorithm, analyze approximation guarantees, and compare performance with simulation-based inference on two distinct complex decision tasks. 
Syntactic constituency parsing is a fundamental problem in natural language processing and has been the subject of intensive research and engineering for decades. As a result, the most accurate parsers are domain specific, complex, and inefficient. In this paper we show that the domain agnostic attention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence model achieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely used syntactic constituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic corpus that was annotated using existing parsers. It also matches the performance of standard parsers when trained only on a small human-annotated dataset, which shows that this model is highly data-efficient, in contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without the attention mechanism. Our parser is also fast, processing over a hundred sentences per second with an unoptimized CPU implementation.  
Trace regression models have received considerable attention in the context of matrix completion, quantum state tomography, and compressed sensing. Estimation of the underlying matrix from regularization-based approaches promoting low-rankedness, notably nuclear norm regularization, have enjoyed great popularity. In this paper, we argue that such regularization may no longer be necessary if the underlying matrix is symmetric positive semidefinite (spd) and the design satisfies certain conditions. In this situation, simple least squares estimation subject to an spd constraint may perform as well as regularization-based approaches with a proper choice of regularization parameter, which entails knowledge of the noise level and/or tuning. By contrast, constrained least squares estimation comes without any tuning parameter and may hence be preferred due to its simplicity.  
In this paper, we propose a winner-take-all method for learning hierarchical sparse representations in an unsupervised fashion. We first introduce fully-connected winner-take-all autoencoders which use mini-batch statistics to directly enforce a lifetime sparsity in the activations of the hidden units. We then propose the convolutional winner-take-all autoencoder which combines the benefits of convolutional architectures and autoencoders for learning shift-invariant sparse representations. We describe a way to train convolutional autoencoders layer by layer, where in addition to lifetime sparsity, a spatial sparsity within each feature map is achieved using winner-take-all activation functions. We will show that winner-take-all autoencoders can be used to to learn deep sparse representations from the MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Street View House Numbers and Toronto Face datasets, and achieve competitive classification performance.  
We propose a new deep architecture for topic modeling, based on Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) modules. The model is composed of a Poisson distribution to model observed vectors of counts, as well as a deep hierarchy of hidden binary units. Rather than using logistic functions to characterize the probability that a latent binary unit is on, we employ a Bernoulli-Poisson link, which allows PFA modules to be used repeatedly in the deep architecture. We also describe an approach to build discriminative topic models, by adapting PFA modules. We derive efficient inference via MCMC and stochastic variational methods, that scale with the number of non-zeros in the data and binary units, yielding significant efficiency, relative to models based on logistic links. Experiments on several corpora demonstrate the advantages of our model when compared to related deep models. 
This paper presents a Bayesian optimization method with exponential convergence without the need of auxiliary optimization and without the δ-cover sampling. Most Bayesian optimization methods require auxiliary optimization: an additional non-convex global optimization problem, which can be time-consuming and hard to implement in practice. Also, the existing Bayesian optimization method with exponential convergence [1] requires access to the δ-cover sampling, which was considered to be impractical [1, 2]. Our approach eliminates both requirements and achieves an exponential convergence rate.  
Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding reinforcement learning in discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) by deriving tight sample complexity bounds. However, in many real-world applications, an interactive learning agent operates for a fixed or bounded period of time, for example tutoring students for exams or handling customer service requests. Such scenarios can often be better treated as episodic fixed-horizon MDPs, for which only looser bounds on the sample complexity exist. A natural notion of sample complexity in this setting is the number of episodes required to guarantee a certain performance with high probability (PAC guarantee). In this paper, we derive an upper PAC bound  and a lower PAC bound that match up to log-terms and an additional linear dependency on the number of states |S|. The lower bound is the first of its kind for this setting. Our upper bound leverages Bernstein’s inequality to improve on previous bounds for episodic finitehorizon MDPs which have a time-horizon dependency of at least H 3 .  
For weakly-supervised problems with deterministic constraints between the latent variables and observed output, learning necessitates performing inference over latent variables conditioned on the output, which can be intractable no matter how simple the model family is. Even finding a single latent variable setting that satisfies the constraints could be difficult; for instance, the observed output may be the result of a latent database query or graphics program which must be inferred. Here, the difficulty lies in not the model but the supervision, and poor approximations at this stage could lead to following the wrong learning signal entirely. In this paper, we develop a rigorous approach to relaxing the supervision, which yields asymptotically consistent parameter estimates despite altering the supervision. Our approach parameterizes a family of increasingly accurate relaxations, and jointly optimizes both the model and relaxation parameters, while formulating constraints between these parameters to ensure efficient inference. These efficiency constraints allow us to learn in otherwise intractable settings, while asymptotic consistency ensures that we always follow a valid learning signal.  
We present an algorithm for recovering planted solutions in two well-known models, the stochastic block model and planted constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), via a common generalization in terms of random bipartite graphs. Our algorithm matches up to a constant factor the best-known bounds for the number of edges (or constraints) needed for perfect recovery and its running time is linear in the number of edges used. The time complexity is significantly better than both spectral and SDP-based approaches. The main contribution of the algorithm is in the case of unequal sizes in the bipartition that arises in our reduction from the planted CSP. Here our algorithm succeeds at a significantly lower density than the spectral approaches, surpassing a barrier based on the spectral norm of a random matrix. Other significant features of the algorithm and analysis include (i) the critical use of power iteration with subsampling, which might be of independent interest; its analysis requires keeping track of multiple norms of an evolving solution (ii) the algorithm can be implemented statistically, i.e., with very limited access to the input distribution (iii) the algorithm is extremely simple to implement and runs in linear time, and thus is practical even for very large instances.  
We study accelerated mirror descent dynamics in continuous and discrete time. Combining the original continuous-time motivation of mirror descent with a recent ODE interpretation of Nesterov’s accelerated method, we propose a family of continuous-time descent dynamics for convex functions with Lipschitz gradients, such that the solution trajectories converge to the optimum at a O(1/t2 ) rate. We then show that a large family of first-order accelerated methods can be obtained as a discretization of the ODE, and these methods converge at a O(1/k 2 ) rate. This connection between accelerated mirror descent and the ODE provides an intuitive approach to the design and analysis of accelerated first-order algorithms.  
Bayesian nonparametric models, such as Gaussian processes, provide a compelling framework for automatic statistical modelling: these models have a high degree of flexibility, and automatically calibrated complexity. However, automating human expertise remains elusive; for example, Gaussian processes with standard kernels struggle on function extrapolation problems that are trivial for human learners. In this paper, we create function extrapolation problems and acquire human responses, and then design a kernel learning framework to reverse engineer the inductive biases of human learners across a set of behavioral experiments. We use the learned kernels to gain psychological insights and to extrapolate in humanlike ways that go beyond traditional stationary and polynomial kernels. Finally, we investigate Occam’s razor in human and Gaussian process based function learning.  
Motivated by vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) problems, in particular Atari games from the recent benchmark Aracade Learning Environment (ALE), we consider spatio-temporal prediction problems where future image-frames depend on control variables or actions as well as previous frames. While not composed of natural scenes, frames in Atari games are high-dimensional in size, can involve tens of objects with one or more objects being controlled by the actions directly and many other objects being influenced indirectly, can involve entry and departure of objects, and can involve deep partial observability. We propose and evaluate two deep neural network architectures that consist of encoding, actionconditional transformation, and decoding layers based on convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Experimental results show that the proposed architectures are able to generate visually-realistic frames that are also useful for control over approximately 100-step action-conditional futures in some games. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to make and evaluate long-term predictions on high-dimensional video conditioned by control inputs.  
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular model for blind signal separation. The ICA model assumes that a number of independent source signals are linearly mixed to form the observed signals. We propose a new algorithm, PEGI (for pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), for provable model recovery for ICA with Gaussian noise. The main technical innovation of the algorithm is to use a fixed point iteration in a pseudo-Euclidean (indefinite “inner product”) space. The use of this indefinite “inner product” resolves technical issues common to several existing algorithms for noisy ICA. This leads to an algorithm which is conceptually simple, efficient and accurate in testing. Our second contribution is combining PEGI with the analysis of objectives for optimal recovery in the noisy ICA model. It has been observed that the direct approach of demixing with the inverse of the mixing matrix is suboptimal for signal recovery in terms of the natural Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) criterion. There have been several partial solutions proposed in the ICA literature. It turns out that any solution to the mixing matrix reconstruction problem can be used to construct an SINR-optimal ICA demixing, despite the fact that SINR itself cannot be computed from data. That allows us to obtain a practical and provably SINR-optimal recovery method for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise.  
How can one find a subset, ideally as small as possible, that well represents a massive dataset? I.e., its corresponding utility, measured according to a suitable utility function, should be comparable to that of the whole dataset. In this paper, we formalize this challenge as a submodular cover problem. Here, the utility is assumed to exhibit submodularity, a natural diminishing returns condition prevalent in many data summarization applications. The classical greedy algorithm is known to provide solutions with logarithmic approximation guarantees compared to the optimum solution. However, this sequential, centralized approach is impractical for truly large-scale problems. In this work, we develop the first distributed algorithm – D IS C OVER – for submodular set cover that is easily implementable using MapReduce-style computations. We theoretically analyze our approach, and present approximation guarantees for the solutions returned by D IS C OVER. We also study a natural trade-off between the communication cost and the number of rounds required to obtain such a solution. In our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several applications, including active set selection, exemplar based clustering, and vertex cover on tens of millions of data points using Spark.  
We present a new algorithm for community detection. The algorithm uses random walks to embed the graph in a space of measures, after which a modification of k-means in that space is applied. The algorithm is therefore fast and easily parallelizable. We evaluate the algorithm on standard random graph benchmarks, including some overlapping community benchmarks, and find its performance to be better or at least as good as previously known algorithms. We also prove a linear time (in number of edges) guarantee for the algorithm on a p, q-stochastic q   block model with where p ≥ c · N − 2 + and p − q ≥ c0 pN − 2 + log N .  
We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing basis function construction for linear value function approximation in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We show that important existing methods, such as Krylov bases and Bellman-errorbased methods are a special case of the general framework we develop. We provide a general algorithmic framework for computing basis function refinements which “respect” the dynamics of the environment, and we derive approximation error bounds that apply for any algorithm respecting this general framework. We also show how, using ideas related to bisimulation metrics, one can translate basis refinement into a process of finding “prototypes” that are diverse enough to represent the given MDP.  
 For structured estimation problems with atomic norms, recent advances in the literature express sample complexity and estimation error bounds in terms of certain geometric measures, in particular Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, Gaussian width of a spherical cap induced by a tangent cone, and a restricted norm compatibility constant. However, given an atomic norm, bounding these geometric measures can be difficult. In this paper, we present general upper bounds for such geometric measures, which only require simple information of the atomic norm under consideration, and we establish tightness of these bounds by providing the corresponding lower bounds. We show applications of our analysis to certain atomic norms, especially k-support norm, for which existing result is incomplete.  
Many recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers leverage continuous dynamics to define a transition kernel that efficiently explores a target distribution. In tandem, a focus has been on devising scalable variants that subsample the data and use stochastic gradients in place of full-data gradients in the dynamic simulations. However, such stochastic gradient MCMC samplers have lagged behind their full-data counterparts in terms of the complexity of dynamics considered since proving convergence in the presence of the stochastic gradient noise is nontrivial. Even with simple dynamics, significant physical intuition is often required to modify the dynamical system to account for the stochastic gradient noise. In this paper, we provide a general recipe for constructing MCMC samplers—including stochastic gradient versions—based on continuous Markov processes specified via two matrices. We constructively prove that the framework is complete. That is, any continuous Markov process that provides samples from the target distribution can be written in our framework. We show how previous continuous-dynamic samplers can be trivially “reinvented” in our framework, avoiding the complicated sampler-specific proofs. We likewise use our recipe to straightforwardly propose a new state-adaptive sampler: stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC). Our experiments on simulated data and a streaming Wikipedia analysis demonstrate that the proposed SGRHMC sampler inherits the benefits of Riemann HMC, with the scalability of stochastic gradient methods.  
Bandit convex optimization is one of the fundamental problems in the field of online learning. The best algorithm for the general bandit convex optimizae 5/6 ), while the best known lower bound tion problem guarantees a regret of O(T /2 is ⌦(T ). Many attempts have been made to bridge the huge gap between these bounds. A particularly interesting special case of this problem assumes that the loss functions are smooth. In this case, the best known algorithm guarantees a ree 2/3 ). We present an efficient algorithm for the bandit smooth convex gret of O(T e 5/8 ). Our result rules out optimization problem that guarantees a regret of O(T an ⌦(T 2/3 ) lower bound and takes a significant step towards the resolution of this open problem.  
We design an online algorithm to classify the vertices of a graph. Underpinning the algorithm is the probability distribution of an Ising model isomorphic to the graph. Each classification is based on predicting the label with maximum marginal probability in the limit of zero-temperature with respect to the labels and vertices seen so far. Computing these classifications is unfortunately based on a #P complete problem. This motivates us to develop an algorithm for which we give a sequential guarantee in the online mistake bound framework. Our algorithm is optimal when the graph is a tree matching the prior results in [1]. For a general graph, the algorithm exploits the additional connectivity over a tree to provide a per-cluster bound. The algorithm is efficient, as the cumulative time to sequentially predict all of the vertices of the graph is quadratic in the size of the graph.  
We present a unified framework for learning continuous control policies using backpropagation. It supports stochastic control by treating stochasticity in the Bellman equation as a deterministic function of exogenous noise. The product is a spectrum of general policy gradient algorithms that range from model-free methods with value functions to model-based methods without value functions. We use learned models but only require observations from the environment instead of observations from model-predicted trajectories, minimizing the impact of compounded model errors. We apply these algorithms first to a toy stochastic control problem and then to several physics-based control problems in simulation. One of these variants, SVG(1), shows the effectiveness of learning models, value functions, and policies simultaneously in continuous domains.  
This work aims to address the problem of image-based question-answering (QA) with new models and datasets. In our work, we propose to use neural networks and visual semantic embeddings, without intermediate stages such as object detection and image segmentation, to predict answers to simple questions about images. Our model performs 1.8 times better than the only published results on an existing image QA dataset. We also present a question generation algorithm that converts image descriptions, which are widely available, into QA form. We used this algorithm to produce an order-of-magnitude larger dataset, with more evenly distributed answers. A suite of baseline results on this new dataset are also presented.  
The success of machine learning in a broad range of applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used off the shelf by non-experts. To be effective in practice, such systems need to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature preprocessing steps for a new dataset at hand, and also set their respective hyperparameters. Recent work has started to tackle this automated machine learning (AutoML) problem with the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods. Building on this, we introduce a robust new AutoML system based on scikit-learn (using 15 classifiers, 14 feature preprocessing methods, and 4 data preprocessing methods, giving rise to a structured hypothesis space with 10 hyperparameters). This system, which we dub AUTO - SKLEARN, improves on existing AutoML methods by automatically taking into account past performance on similar datasets, and by constructing ensembles from the models evaluated during the optimization. Our system won the first phase of the ongoing ChaLearn AutoML challenge, and our comprehensive analysis on over 100 diverse datasets shows that it substantially outperforms the previous state of the art in AutoML. We also demonstrate the performance gains due to each of our contributions and derive insights into the effectiveness of the individual components of AUTO - SKLEARN.  
Deep learning presents notorious computational challenges. These challenges include, but are not limited to, the non-convexity of learning objectives and estimating the quantities needed for optimization algorithms, such as gradients. While we do not address the non-convexity, we present an optimization solution that exploits the so far unused “geometry” in the objective function in order to best make use of the estimated gradients. Previous work attempted similar goals with preconditioned methods in the Euclidean space, such as L-BFGS, RMSprop, and ADAgrad. In stark contrast, our approach combines a non-Euclidean gradient method with preconditioning. We provide evidence that this combination more accurately captures the geometry of the objective function compared to prior work. We theoretically formalize our arguments and derive novel preconditioned non-Euclidean algorithms. The results are promising in both computational time and quality when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Feedforward Neural Nets, and Convolutional Neural Nets.  
In this paper, we explore the inclusion of latent random variables into the hidden state of a recurrent neural network (RNN) by combining the elements of the variational autoencoder. We argue that through the use of high-level latent random variables, the variational RNN (VRNN)1 can model the kind of variability observed in highly structured sequential data such as natural speech. We empirically evaluate the proposed model against other related sequential models on four speech datasets and one handwriting dataset. Our results show the important roles that latent random variables can play in the RNN dynamics.  
We show that natural classes of regularized learning algorithms with a form of recency bias achieve faster convergence rates to approximate efficiency and to coarse correlated equilibria in multiplayer normal form games. When each player in a game uses an algorithm from our class, their individual regret decays at O(T 3/4 ), while the sum of utilities converges to an approximate optimum at O(T 1 )–an improvement upon the worst case O(T 1/2 ) rates. We show a blackbox reduction for any algorithm in the class to achieve Õ(T 1/2 ) rates against an adversary, while maintaining the faster rates against algorithms in the class. Our results extend those of Rakhlin and Shridharan [17] and Daskalakis et al. [4], who only analyzed two-player zero-sum games for specific algorithms.  
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be shifted across 2D images or 3D videos to segment them. They have a fixed input size and typically perceive only small local contexts of the pixels to be classified as foreground or background. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional Recurrent NNs (MD-RNNs) can perceive the entire spatio-temporal context of each pixel in a few sweeps through all pixels, especially when the RNN is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Despite these theoretical advantages, however, unlike CNNs, previous MD-LSTM variants were hard to parallelise on GPUs. Here we re-arrange the traditional cuboid order of computations in MD-LSTM in pyramidal fashion. The resulting PyraMiD-LSTM is easy to parallelise, especially for 3D data such as stacks of brain slice images. PyraMiD-LSTM achieved best known pixel-wise brain image segmentation results on MRBrainS13 (and competitive results on EM-ISBI12).  
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a successful approach for sampling from continuous densities. However, it has difficulty simulating Hamiltonian dynamics with non-smooth functions, leading to poor performance. This paper is motivated by the behavior of Hamiltonian dynamics in physical systems like optics. We introduce a modification of the Leapfrog discretization of Hamiltonian dynamics on piecewise continuous energies, where intersections of the trajectory with discontinuities are detected, and the momentum is reflected or refracted to compensate for the change in energy. We prove that this method preserves the correct stationary distribution when boundaries are affine. Experiments show that by reducing the number of rejected samples, this method improves on traditional HMC.  
Link prediction and clustering are key problems for network-structured data. While spectral clustering has strong theoretical guarantees under the popular stochastic blockmodel formulation of networks, it can be expensive for large graphs. On the other hand, the heuristic of predicting links to nodes that share the most common neighbors with the query node is much fast, and works very well in practice. We show theoretically that the common neighbors heuristic can extract clusters with high probability when the graph is dense enough, and can do so even in sparser graphs with the addition of a “cleaning” step. Empirical results on simulated and real-world data support our conclusions.  
We present a nearly optimal differentially private version of the well known LASSO estimator. Our algorithm provides privacy protection with respect to each training example. The excess risk of our algorithm, compared to the non-private 2/3 e version, is O(1/n ), assuming all the input data has bounded `∞ norm. This is the first differentially private algorithm that achieves such a bound without the polynomial dependence on p under no additional assumptions on the design matrix. In addition, we show that this error bound is nearly optimal amongst all differentially private algorithms.  
Prediction markets are economic mechanisms for aggregating information about future events through sequential interactions with traders. The pricing mechanisms in these markets are known to be related to optimization algorithms in machine learning and through these connections we have some understanding of how equilibrium market prices relate to the beliefs of the traders in a market. However, little is known about rates and guarantees for the convergence of these sequential mechanisms, and two recent papers cite this as an important open question. In this paper we show how some previously studied prediction market trading models can be understood as a natural generalization of randomized coordinate descent which we call randomized subspace descent (RSD). We establish convergence rates for RSD and leverage them to prove rates for the two prediction market models above, answering the open questions. Our results extend beyond standard centralized markets to arbitrary trade networks.  
To infer a multilayer representation of high-dimensional count vectors, we propose the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN) that factorizes each of its layers into the product of a connection weight matrix and the nonnegative real hidden units of the next layer. The PGBN’s hidden layers are jointly trained with an upward-downward Gibbs sampler, each iteration of which upward samples Dirichlet distributed connection weight vectors starting from the first layer (bottom data layer), and then downward samples gamma distributed hidden units starting from the top hidden layer. The gamma-negative binomial process combined with a layer-wise training strategy allows the PGBN to infer the width of each layer given a fixed budget on the width of the first layer. The PGBN with a single hidden layer reduces to Poisson factor analysis. Example results on text analysis illustrate interesting relationships between the width of the first layer and the inferred network structure, and demonstrate that the PGBN, whose hidden units are imposed with correlated gamma priors, can add more layers to increase its performance gains over Poisson factor analysis, given the same limit on the width of the first layer.  
We consider the problem of minimizing a sum of n functions via projected iterations onto a convex parameter set C ⇢ Rp , where n p . In this regime, algorithms which utilize sub-sampling techniques are known to be effective. In this paper, we use sub-sampling techniques together with low-rank approximation to design a new randomized batch algorithm which possesses comparable convergence rate to Newton’s method, yet has much smaller per-iteration cost. The proposed algorithm is robust in terms of starting point and step size, and enjoys a composite convergence rate, namely, quadratic convergence at start and linear convergence when the iterate is close to the minimizer. We develop its theoretical analysis which also allows us to select near-optimal algorithm parameters. Our theoretical results can be used to obtain convergence rates of previously proposed sub-sampling based algorithms as well. We demonstrate how our results apply to well-known machine learning problems. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several datasets under various scenarios.  
Recent price-of-anarchy analyses of games of complete information suggest that coarse correlated equilibria, which characterize outcomes resulting from no-regret learning dynamics, have near-optimal welfare. This work provides two main technical results that lift this conclusion to games of incomplete information, a.k.a., Bayesian games. First, near-optimal welfare in Bayesian games follows directly from the smoothness-based proof of near-optimal welfare in the same game when the private information is public. Second, no-regret learning dynamics converge to Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium in these incomplete information games. These results are enabled by interpretation of a Bayesian game as a stochastic game of complete information.  
We consider the problem of statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data. These diagrams encode persistent homology, a widely used invariant in topological data analysis. While several avenues towards a statistical treatment of the diagrams have been explored recently, we follow an alternative route that is motivated by the success of methods based on the embedding of probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In fact, a positive definite kernel on persistence diagrams has recently been proposed, connecting persistent homology to popular kernel-based learning techniques such as support vector machines. However, important properties of that kernel enabling a principled use in the context of probability measure embeddings remain to be explored. Our contribution is to close this gap by proving universality of a variant of the original kernel, and to demonstrate its effective use in twosample hypothesis testing on synthetic as well as real-world data.  
We present two approaches to use unlabeled data to improve Sequence Learning with recurrent networks. The first approach is to predict what comes next in a sequence, which is a language model in NLP. The second approach is to use a sequence autoencoder, which reads the input sequence into a vector and predicts the input sequence again. These two algorithms can be used as a “pretraining” algorithm for a later supervised sequence learning algorithm. In other words, the parameters obtained from the pretraining step can then be used as a starting point for other supervised training models. In our experiments, we find that long short term memory recurrent networks after pretrained with the two approaches become more stable to train and generalize better. With pretraining, we were able to achieve strong performance in many classification tasks, such as text classification with IMDB, DBpedia or image recognition in CIFAR-10.  
We consider the task of building compact deep learning pipelines suitable for deployment on storage and power constrained mobile devices. We propose a unified framework to learn a broad family of structured parameter matrices that are characterized by the notion of low displacement rank. Our structured transforms admit fast function and gradient evaluation, and span a rich range of parameter sharing configurations whose statistical modeling capacity can be explicitly tuned along a continuum from structured to unstructured. Experimental results show that these transforms can significantly accelerate inference and forward/backward passes during training, and offer superior accuracy-compactness-speed tradeoffs in comparison to a number of existing techniques. In keyword spotting applications in mobile speech recognition, our methods are much more effective than standard linear low-rank bottleneck layers and nearly retain the performance of state of the art models, while providing more than 3.5-fold compression.  
Gibbs sampling on factor graphs is a widely used inference technique, which often produces good empirical results. Theoretical guarantees for its performance are weak: even for tree structured graphs, the mixing time of Gibbs may be exponential in the number of variables. To help understand the behavior of Gibbs sampling, we introduce a new (hyper)graph property, called hierarchy width. We show that under suitable conditions on the weights, bounded hierarchy width ensures polynomial mixing time. Our study of hierarchy width is in part motivated by a class of factor graph templates, hierarchical templates, which have bounded hierarchy width—regardless of the data used to instantiate them. We demonstrate a rich application from natural language processing in which Gibbs sampling provably mixes rapidly and achieves accuracy that exceeds human volunteers.  
We consider the problem of recovering a low-rank tensor from its noisy observation. Previous work has shown a recovery guarantee with signal to noise ratio O(ndK/2e/2 ) for recovering a Kth order rank one tensor of size n × · · · × n by recursive unfolding. In this paper, we first improve this bound to O(nK/4 ) by a much simpler approach, but with a more careful analysis. Then we propose a new norm called the subspace norm, which is based on the Kronecker products of factors obtained by the proposed simple estimator. The imposed Kronecker structure √ √ allows us to show a nearly ideal O( n + H K−1 ) bound, in which the parameter H controls the blend from the non-convex estimator to mode-wise nuclear norm minimization. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that the subspace norm achieves the nearly ideal denoising performance even with H = O(1).  
This paper is concerned with robustness analysis of decision making under uncertainty. We consider a class of iterative stochastic policy optimization problems and analyze the resulting expected performance for each newly updated policy at each iteration. In particular, we employ concentration-of-measure inequalities to compute future expected cost and probability of constraint violation using empirical runs. A novel inequality bound is derived that accounts for the possibly unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratio resulting from iterative policy adaptation. The bound serves as a high-confidence certificate for providing future performance or safety guarantees. The approach is illustrated with a simple robot control scenario and initial steps towards applications to challenging aerial vehicle navigation problems are presented.  
Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks, with the best results obtained with large training sets and large models. In the past, GPUs enabled these breakthroughs because of their greater computational speed. In the future, faster computation at both training and test time is likely to be crucial for further progress and for consumer applications on low-power devices. As a result, there is much interest in research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL). Binary weights, i.e., weights which are constrained to only two possible values (e.g. -1 or 1), would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, as multipliers are the most space and powerhungry components of the digital implementation of neural networks. We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated. Like other dropout schemes, we show that BinaryConnect acts as regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.  
We present a method for training recurrent neural networks to act as near-optimal feedback controllers. It is able to generate stable and realistic behaviors for a range of dynamical systems and tasks – swimming, flying, biped and quadruped walking with different body morphologies. It does not require motion capture or task-specific features or state machines. The controller is a neural network, having a large number of feed-forward units that learn elaborate state-action mappings, and a small number of recurrent units that implement memory states beyond the physical system state. The action generated by the network is defined as velocity. Thus the network is not learning a control policy, but rather the dynamics under an implicit policy. Essential features of the method include interleaving supervised learning with trajectory optimization, injecting noise during training, training for unexpected changes in the task specification, and using the trajectory optimizer to obtain optimal feedback gains in addition to optimal actions.  
We show that there is a largely unexplored class of functions (positive polymatroids) that can define proper discrete metrics over pairs of binary vectors and that are fairly tractable to optimize over. By exploiting submodularity, we are able to give hardness results and approximation algorithms for optimizing over such metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of these metrics and associated algorithms on both a metric minimization task (a form of clustering) and also a metric maximization task (generating diverse k-best lists).  
We propose a new primal-dual algorithmic framework for a prototypical constrained convex optimization template. The algorithmic instances of our framework are universal since they can automatically adapt to the unknown Hölder continuity degree and constant within the dual formulation. They are also guaranteed to have optimal convergence rates in the objective residual and the feasibility gap for each Hölder smoothness degree. In contrast to existing primal-dual algorithms, our framework avoids the proximity operator of the objective function. We instead leverage computationally cheaper, Fenchel-type operators, which are the main workhorses of the generalized conditional gradient (GCG)-type methods. In contrast to the GCG-type methods, our framework does not require the objective function to be differentiable, and can also process additional general linear inclusion constraints, while guarantees the convergence rate on the primal problem.  
Simple decision heuristics are models of human and animal behavior that use few pieces of information—perhaps only a single piece of information—and integrate the pieces in simple ways, for example, by considering them sequentially, one at a time, or by giving them equal weight. We focus on three families of heuristics: single-cue decision making, lexicographic decision making, and tallying. It is unknown how quickly these heuristics can be learned from experience. We show, analytically and empirically, that substantial progress in learning can be made with just a few training samples. When training samples are very few, tallying performs substantially better than the alternative methods tested. Our empirical analysis is the most extensive to date, employing 63 natural data sets on diverse subjects.  
This work addresses the problem of regret minimization in non-stochastic multiarmed bandit problems, focusing on performance guarantees that hold with high probability. Such results are rather scarce in the literature since proving them requires a large deal of technical effort and significant modifications to the standard, more intuitive algorithms that come only with guarantees that hold on expectation. One of these modifications √ is forcing the learner to sample arms from the uniform distribution at least Ω( T ) times over T rounds, which can adversely affect performance if many of the arms are suboptimal. While it is widely conjectured that this property is essential for proving high-probability regret bounds, we show in this paper that it is possible to achieve such strong results without this undesirable exploration component. Our result relies on a simple and intuitive loss-estimation strategy called Implicit eXploration (IX) that allows a remarkably clean analysis. To demonstrate the flexibility of our technique, we derive several improved high-probability bounds for various extensions of the standard multi-armed bandit framework. Finally, we conduct a simple experiment that illustrates the robustness of our implicit exploration technique.  
In this paper, we revisit the problem of constructing a near-optimal rank k approximation of a matrix M ∈ [0, 1]m×n under the streaming data model where the columns of M are revealed sequentially. We present SLA (Streaming Low-rank Approximation), an algorithm that is asymptotically accurate, when ksk+1 (M ) = √ o( mn) where sk+1 (M ) is the (k + 1)-th largest singular value of M . This means that its average mean-square error converges to 0 as m and n grow large (i.e., kM̂ (k) −M (k) k2F = o(mn) with high probability, where M̂ (k) and M (k) denote the output of SLA and the optimal rank k approximation of M , respectively). Our algorithm makes one pass on the data if the columns of M are revealed in a random order, and two passes if the columns of M arrive in an arbitrary order. To reduce its memory footprint and complexity, SLA uses random sparsification, and samples each entry of M with a small probability δ. In turn, SLA is memory optimal as its required memory space scales as k(m+n), the dimension of its output. Furthermore, SLA is computationally efficient as it runs in O(δkmn) time (a constant number of operations is made for each observed entry of M ), which can be as small as O(k log(m)4 n) for an appropriate choice of δ and if n ≥ m.  
We show PAC learnability of influence functions for three common influence models, namely, the Linear Threshold (LT), Independent Cascade (IC) and Voter models, and present concrete sample complexity results in each case. Our results for the LT model are based on interesting connections with neural networks; those for the IC model are based an interpretation of the influence function as an expectation over random draw of a subgraph and use covering number arguments; and those for the Voter model are based on a reduction to linear regression. We show these results for the case in which the cascades are only partially observed and we do not see the time steps in which a node has been influenced. We also provide efficient polynomial time learning algorithms for a setting with full observation, i.e. where the cascades also contain the time steps in which nodes are influenced.  
We consider the problem of learning causal networks with interventions, when each intervention is limited in size under Pearl’s Structural Equation Model with independent errors (SEM-IE). The objective is to minimize the number of experiments to discover the causal directions of all the edges in a causal graph. Previous work has focused on the use of separating systems for complete graphs for this task. We prove that any deterministic adaptive algorithm needs to be a separating system in order to learn complete graphs in the worst case. In addition, we present a novel separating system construction, whose size is close to optimal and is arguably simpler than previous work in combinatorics. We also develop a novel information theoretic lower bound on the number of interventions that applies in full generality, including for randomized adaptive learning algorithms. For general chordal graphs, we derive worst case lower bounds on the number of interventions. Building on observations about induced trees, we give a new deterministic adaptive algorithm to learn directions on any chordal skeleton completely. In the worst case, our achievable scheme is an ↵-approximation algorithm where ↵ is the independence number of the graph. We also show that there exist graph classes for which the sufficient number of experiments is close to the lower bound. In the other extreme, there are graph classes for which the required number of experiments is multiplicatively ↵ away from our lower bound. In simulations, our algorithm almost always performs very close to the lower bound, while the approach based on separating systems for complete graphs is significantly worse for random chordal graphs.  
We consider the problem of optimizing convex and concave functions with access to an erroneous zeroth-order oracle. In particular, for a given function x → f (x) we consider optimization when one is given access to absolute error oracles that return values in [f (x) − , f (x) + ] or relative error oracles that return value in [(1 − )f (x), (1 + )f (x)], for some  > 0. We show stark information theoretic impossibility results for minimizing convex functions and maximizing concave functions over polytopes in this model.  
We propose a novel distribution that generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. Our novel distribution is based on the parametric form of the Poisson MRF model [1] but is fundamentally different because of the domain restriction to a fixed-length vector like in a Multinomial where the number of trials is fixed or known. Thus, we propose the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF) distribution. We develop AIS sampling methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function (i.e. the log normalizing constant), which was not developed for the Poisson MRF model. In addition, we propose novel mixture and topic models that use LPMRF as a base distribution and discuss the similarities and differences with previous topic models such as the recently proposed Admixture of Poisson MRFs [2]. We show the effectiveness of our LPMRF distribution over Multinomial models by evaluating the test set perplexity on a dataset of abstracts and Wikipedia. Qualitatively, we show that the positive dependencies discovered by LPMRF are interesting and intuitive. Finally, we show that our algorithms are fast and have good scaling (code available online).  
We present a scalable Bayesian multi-label learning model based on learning lowdimensional label embeddings. Our model assumes that each label vector is generated as a weighted combination of a set of topics (each topic being a distribution over labels), where the combination weights (i.e., the embeddings) for each label vector are conditioned on the observed feature vector. This construction, coupled with a Bernoulli-Poisson link function for each label of the binary label vector, leads to a model with a computational cost that scales in the number of positive labels in the label matrix. This makes the model particularly appealing for real-world multi-label learning problems where the label matrix is usually very massive but highly sparse. Using a data-augmentation strategy leads to full local conjugacy in our model, facilitating simple and very efficient Gibbs sampling, as well as an Expectation Maximization algorithm for inference. Also, predicting the label vector at test time does not require doing an inference for the label embeddings and can be done in closed form. We report results on several benchmark data sets, comparing our model with various state-of-the art methods.  
This paper identifies a severe problem of the counterfactual risk estimator typically used in batch learning from logged bandit feedback (BLBF), and proposes the use of an alternative estimator that avoids this problem. In the BLBF setting, the learner does not receive full-information feedback like in supervised learning, but observes feedback only for the actions taken by a historical policy. This makes BLBF algorithms particularly attractive for training online systems (e.g., ad placement, web search, recommendation) using their historical logs. The Counterfactual Risk Minimization (CRM) principle [1] offers a general recipe for designing BLBF algorithms. It requires a counterfactual risk estimator, and virtually all existing works on BLBF have focused on a particular unbiased estimator. We show that this conventional estimator suffers from a propensity overfitting problem when used for learning over complex hypothesis spaces. We propose to replace the risk estimator with a self-normalized estimator, showing that it neatly avoids this problem. This naturally gives rise to a new learning algorithm – Normalized Policy Optimizer for Exponential Models (Norm-POEM) – for structured output prediction using linear rules. We evaluate the empirical effectiveness of NormPOEM on several multi-label classification problems, finding that it consistently outperforms the conventional estimator.  
Recently, there has been growing interest in lifting MAP inference algorithms for Markov logic networks (MLNs). A key advantage of these lifted algorithms is that they have much smaller computational complexity than propositional algorithms when symmetries are present in the MLN and these symmetries can be detected using lifted inference rules. Unfortunately, lifted inference rules are sound but not complete and can often miss many symmetries. This is problematic because when symmetries cannot be exploited, lifted inference algorithms ground the MLN, and search for solutions in the much larger propositional space. In this paper, we present a novel approach, which cleverly introduces new symmetries at the time of grounding. Our main idea is to partition the ground atoms and force the inference algorithm to treat all atoms in each part as indistinguishable. We show that by systematically and carefully refining (and growing) the partitions, we can build advanced any-time and any-space MAP inference algorithms. Our experiments on several real-world datasets clearly show that our new algorithm is superior to previous approaches and often finds useful symmetries in the search space that existing lifted inference rules are unable to detect.  
 We connect a broad class of generative models through their shared reliance on sequential decision making. Motivated by this view, we develop extensions to an existing model, and then explore the idea further in the context of data imputation – perhaps the simplest setting in which to investigate the relation between unconditional and conditional generative modelling. We formulate data imputation as an MDP and develop models capable of representing effective policies for it. We construct the models using neural networks and train them using a form of guided policy search [9]. Our models generate predictions through an iterative process of feedback and refinement. We show that this approach can learn effective policies for imputation problems of varying difficulty and across multiple datasets.  
Elicitation is the study of statistics or properties which are computable via empirical risk minimization. While several recent papers have approached the general question of which properties are elicitable, we suggest that this is the wrong question—all properties are elicitable by first eliciting the entire distribution or data set, and thus the important question is how elicitable. Specifically, what is the minimum number of regression parameters needed to compute the property? Building on previous work, we introduce a new notion of elicitation complexity and lay the foundations for a calculus of elicitation. We establish several general results and techniques for proving upper and lower bounds on elicitation complexity. These results provide tight bounds for eliciting the Bayes risk of any loss, a large class of properties which includes spectral risk measures and several new properties of interest.  
Marginal MAP inference involves making MAP predictions in systems defined with latent variables or missing information. It is significantly more difficult than pure marginalization and MAP tasks, for which a large class of efficient and convergent variational algorithms, such as dual decomposition, exist. In this work, we generalize dual decomposition to a generic power sum inference task, which includes marginal MAP, along with pure marginalization and MAP, as special cases. Our method is based on a block coordinate descent algorithm on a new convex decomposition bound, that is guaranteed to converge monotonically, and can be parallelized efficiently. We demonstrate our approach on marginal MAP queries defined on real-world problems from the UAI approximate inference challenge, showing that our framework is faster and more reliable than previous methods.  
Finding communities in networks is a problem that remains difficult, in spite of the amount of attention it has recently received. The Stochastic Block-Model (SBM) is a generative model for graphs with “communities” for which, because of its simplicity, the theoretical understanding has advanced fast in recent years. In particular, there have been various results showing that simple versions of spectral clustering using the Normalized Laplacian of the graph can recover the communities almost perfectly with high probability. Here we show that essentially the same algorithm used for the SBM and for its extension called Degree-Corrected SBM, works on a wider class of Block-Models, which we call Preference Frame Models, with essentially the same guarantees. Moreover, the parametrization we introduce clearly exhibits the free parameters needed to specify this class of models, and results in bounds that expose with more clarity the parameters that control the recovery error in this model class.  
We describe an approach for unsupervised learning of a generic, distributed sentence encoder. Using the continuity of text from books, we train an encoderdecoder model that tries to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an encoded passage. Sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties are thus mapped to similar vector representations. We next introduce a simple vocabulary expansion method to encode words that were not seen as part of training, allowing us to expand our vocabulary to a million words. After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity datasets. The end result is an off-the-shelf encoder that can produce highly generic sentence representations that are robust and perform well in practice.  
Causal structure learning from time series data is a major scientific challenge. Extant algorithms assume that measurements occur sufficiently quickly; more precisely, they assume approximately equal system and measurement timescales. In many domains, however, measurements occur at a significantly slower rate than the underlying system changes, but the size of the timescale mismatch is often unknown. This paper develops three causal structure learning algorithms, each of which discovers all dynamic causal graphs that explain the observed measurement data, perhaps given undersampling. That is, these algorithms all learn causal structure in a “rate-agnostic” manner: they do not assume any particular relation between the measurement and system timescales. We apply these algorithms to data from simulations to gain insight into the challenge of undersampling.  
Given a family of probability measures in P (X ), the space of probability measures on a Hilbert space X , our goal in this paper is to highlight one ore more curves in P (X ) that summarize efficiently that family. We propose to study this problem under the optimal transport (Wasserstein) geometry, using curves that are restricted to be geodesic segments under that metric. We show that concepts that play a key role in Euclidean PCA, such as data centering or orthogonality of principal directions, find a natural equivalent in the optimal transport geometry, using Wasserstein means and differential geometry. The implementation of these ideas is, however, computationally challenging. To achieve scalable algorithms that can handle thousands of measures, we propose to use a relaxed definition for geodesics and regularized optimal transport distances. The interest of our approach is demonstrated on images seen either as shapes or color histograms.  
Multilabel classification is rapidly developing as an important aspect of modern predictive modeling, motivating study of its theoretical aspects. To this end, we propose a framework for constructing and analyzing multilabel classification metrics which reveals novel results on a parametric form for population optimal classifiers, and additional insight into the role of label correlations. In particular, we show that for multilabel metrics constructed as instance-, micro- and macroaverages, the population optimal classifier can be decomposed into binary classifiers based on the marginal instance-conditional distribution of each label, with a weak association between labels via the threshold. Thus, our analysis extends the state of the art from a few known multilabel classification metrics such as Hamming loss, to a general framework applicable to many of the classification metrics in common use. Based on the population-optimal classifier, we propose a computationally efficient and general-purpose plug-in classification algorithm, and prove its consistency with respect to the metric of interest. Empirical results on synthetic and benchmark datasets are supportive of our theoretical findings.  
We develop parallel predictive entropy search (PPES), a novel algorithm for Bayesian optimization of expensive black-box objective functions. At each iteration, PPES aims to select a batch of points which will maximize the information gain about the global maximizer of the objective. Well known strategies exist for suggesting a single evaluation point based on previous observations, while far fewer are known for selecting batches of points to evaluate in parallel. The few batch selection schemes that have been studied all resort to greedy methods to compute an optimal batch. To the best of our knowledge, PPES is the first nongreedy batch Bayesian optimization strategy. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach in optimization performance on both synthetic and real world applications, including problems in machine learning, rocket science and robotics.  
We study the restless bandit problem where arms are associated with stationary ϕ-mixing processes and where rewards are therefore dependent: the question that arises from this setting is that of carefully recovering some independence by ‘ignoring’ the values of some rewards. As we shall see, the bandit problem we tackle requires us to address the exploration/exploitation/independence trade-off, which we do by considering the idea of a waiting arm in the new Remix-UCB algorithm, a generalization of Improved-UCB for the problem at hand, that we introduce. We provide a regret analysis for this bandit strategy; two noticeable features of Remix-UCB are that i) it reduces to the regular Improved-UCB when the ϕ-mixing coefficients are all 0, i.e. when the i.i.d scenario is recovered, −α and ii) when ϕ(n) = O(n ), it is able to ensure a controlled regret of order  (α−2)/α /α e Θ ∆∗ log T , where ∆∗ encodes the distance between the best arm and the best suboptimal arm, even in the case when α < 1, i.e. the case when the ϕ-mixing coefficients are not summable.  
Imaging neuroscience links human behavior to aspects of brain biology in everincreasing datasets. Existing neuroimaging methods typically perform either discovery of unknown neural structure or testing of neural structure associated with mental tasks. However, testing hypotheses on the neural correlates underlying larger sets of mental tasks necessitates adequate representations for the observations. We therefore propose to blend representation modelling and task classification into a unified statistical learning problem. A multinomial logistic regression is introduced that is constrained by factored coefficients and coupled with an autoencoder. We show that this approach yields more accurate and interpretable neural models of psychological tasks in a reference dataset, as well as better generalization to other datasets.   
Gaussian processes have been successful in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks, but their computational complexity has constrained practical applications. We introduce a new approximation for large-scale Gaussian processes, the Gaussian Process Random Field (GPRF), in which local GPs are coupled via pairwise potentials. The GPRF likelihood is a simple, tractable, and parallelizeable approximation to the full GP marginal likelihood, enabling latent variable modeling and hyperparameter selection on large datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic spatial data as well as a real-world application to seismic event location.  
Detecting the emergence of an abrupt change-point is a classic problem in statistics and machine learning. Kernel-based nonparametric statistics have been proposed for this task which make fewer assumptions on the distributions than traditional parametric approach. However, none of the existing kernel statistics has provided a computationally efficient way to characterize the extremal behavior of the statistic. Such characterization is crucial for setting the detection threshold, to control the significance level in the offline case as well as the average run length in the online case. In this paper we propose two related computationally efficient M -statistics for kernel-based change-point detection when the amount of background data is large. A novel theoretical result of the paper is the characterization of the tail probability of these statistics using a new technique based on change-ofmeasure. Such characterization provides us accurate detection thresholds for both offline and online cases in computationally efficient manner, without the need to resort to the more expensive simulations such as bootstrapping. We show that our methods perform well in both synthetic and real world data.  
We propose a general framework for studying adaptive regret bounds in the online learning setting, subsuming model selection and data-dependent bounds. Given a data- or model-dependent bound we ask, “Does there exist some algorithm achieving this bound?” We show that modifications to recently introduced sequential complexity measures can be used to answer this question by providing sufficient conditions under which adaptive rates can be achieved. In particular each adaptive rate induces a set of so-called offset complexity measures, and obtaining small upper bounds on these quantities is sufficient to demonstrate achievability. A cornerstone of our analysis technique is the use of one-sided tail inequalities to bound suprema of offset random processes. Our framework recovers and improves a wide variety of adaptive bounds including quantile bounds, second order data-dependent bounds, and small loss bounds. In addition we derive a new type of adaptive bound for online linear optimization based on the spectral norm, as well as a new online PAC-Bayes theorem.  
We introduce a generic scheme for accelerating first-order optimization methods in the sense of Nesterov, which builds upon a new analysis of the accelerated proximal point algorithm. Our approach consists of minimizing a convex objective by approximately solving a sequence of well-chosen auxiliary problems, leading to faster convergence. This strategy applies to a large class of algorithms, including gradient descent, block coordinate descent, SAG, SAGA, SDCA, SVRG, Finito/MISO, and their proximal variants. For all of these methods, we provide acceleration and explicit support for non-strongly convex objectives. In addition to theoretical speed-up, we also show that acceleration is useful in practice, especially for ill-conditioned problems where we measure significant improvements.  
Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are point process models that naturally encode diversity between the points of a given realization, through a positive definite kernel K. DPPs possess desirable properties, such as exact sampling or analyticity of the moments, but learning the parameters of kernel K through likelihood-based inference is not straightforward. First, the kernel that appears in the likelihood is not K, but another kernel L related to K through an often intractable spectral decomposition. This issue is typically bypassed in machine learning by directly parametrizing the kernel L, at the price of some interpretability of the model parameters. We follow this approach here. Second, the likelihood has an intractable normalizing constant, which takes the form of a large determinant in the case of a DPP over a finite set of objects, and the form of a Fredholm determinant in the case of a DPP over a continuous domain. Our main contribution is to derive bounds on the likelihood of a DPP, both for finite and continuous domains. Unlike previous work, our bounds are cheap to evaluate since they do not rely on approximating the spectrum of a large matrix or an operator. Through usual arguments, these bounds thus yield cheap variational inference and moderately expensive exact Markov chain Monte Carlo inference methods for DPPs.  
We propose a new variational inference method based on a proximal framework that uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the proximal term. We make two contributions towards exploiting the geometry and structure of the variational bound. First, we propose a KL proximal-point algorithm and show its equivalence to variational inference with natural gradients (e.g., stochastic variational inference). Second, we use the proximal framework to derive efficient variational algorithms for non-conjugate models. We propose a splitting procedure to separate non-conjugate terms from conjugate ones. We linearize the non-conjugate terms to obtain subproblems that admit a closed-form solution. Overall, our approach converts inference in a non-conjugate model to subproblems that involve inference in well-known conjugate models. We show that our method is applicable to a wide variety of models and can result in computationally efficient algorithms. Applications to real-world datasets show comparable performances to existing methods.  
We propose a new first-order optimization algorithm to solve high-dimensional non-smooth composite minimization problems. Typical examples of such problems have an objective that decomposes into a non-smooth empirical risk part and a non-smooth regularization penalty. The proposed algorithm, called SemiProximal Mirror-Prox, leverages the saddle point representation of one part of the objective while handling the other part of the objective via linear minimization over the domain. The algorithm stands in contrast with more classical proximal gradient algorithms with smoothing, which require the computation of proximal operators at each iteration and can therefore be impractical for high-dimensional problems. We establish the theoretical convergence rate of Semi-Proximal MirrorProx, which exhibits the optimal complexity bounds, i.e. O(1/ǫ2 ), for the number of calls to linear minimization oracle. We present promising experimental results showing the interest of the approach in comparison to competing methods.  
Consider estimating an unknown, but structured (e.g. sparse, low-rank, etc.), signal x0 ∈ Rn from a vector y ∈ Rm of measurements of the form yi = gi (ai T x0 ), where the ai ’s are the rows of a known measurement matrix A, and, g(·) is a (potentially unknown) nonlinear and random link-function. Such measurement functions could arise in applications where the measurement device has nonlinearities and uncertainties. It could also arise by design, e.g., gi (x) = sign(x + zi ), corresponds to noisy 1-bit quantized measurements. Motivated by the classical work of Brillinger, and more recent work of Plan and Vershynin, we estimate x0 via solving the Generalized-LASSO, i.e., x̂ := arg minx ky − Ax0 k2 + λf (x) for some regularization parameter λ > 0 and some (typically non-smooth) convex regularizer f (·) that promotes the structure of x0 , e.g. `1 -norm, nuclear-norm, etc. While this approach seems to naively ignore the nonlinear function g(·), both Brillinger (in the non-constrained case) and Plan and Vershynin have shown that, when the entries of A are iid standard normal, this is a good estimator of x0 up to a constant of proportionality µ, which only depends on g(·). In this work, we considerably strengthen these results by obtaining explicit expressions forkx̂−µx0 k2 , for the regularized Generalized-LASSO, that are asymptotically precise when m and n grow large. A main result is that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as one whose measurements are linear yi = µai T x0 + σzi , with µ = Eγg(γ) and σ 2 = E(g(γ) − µγ)2 , and, γ standard normal. To the best of our knowledge, the derived expressions on the estimation performance are the first-known precise results in this context. One interesting consequence of our result is that the optimal quantizer of the measurements that minimizes the estimation error of the Generalized LASSO is the celebrated Lloyd-Max quantizer.  
Large unweighted directed graphs are commonly used to capture relations between entities. A fundamental problem in the analysis of such networks is to properly define the similarity or dissimilarity between any two vertices. Despite the significance of this problem, statistical characterization of the proposed metrics has been limited. We introduce and develop a class of techniques for analyzing random walks on graphs using stochastic calculus. Using these techniques we generalize results on the degeneracy of hitting times and analyze a metric based on the Laplace transformed hitting time (LTHT). The metric serves as a natural, provably well-behaved alternative to the expected hitting time. We establish a general correspondence between hitting times of the Brownian motion and analogous hitting times on the graph. We show that the LTHT is consistent with respect to the underlying metric of a geometric graph, preserves clustering tendency, and remains robust against random addition of non-geometric edges. Tests on simulated and real-world data show that the LTHT matches theoretical predictions and outperforms alternatives.  
We consider the problem of Bayesian parameter estimation for deep neural networks, which is important in problem settings where we may have little data, and/ or where we need accurate posterior predictive densities p(y|x, D), e.g., for applications involving bandits or active learning. One simple approach to this is to use online Monte Carlo methods, such as SGLD (stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics). Unfortunately, such a method needs to store many copies of the parameters (which wastes memory), and needs to make predictions using many versions of the model (which wastes time). We describe a method for “distilling” a Monte Carlo approximation to the posterior predictive density into a more compact form, namely a single deep neural network. We compare to two very recent approaches to Bayesian neural networks, namely an approach based on expectation propagation [HLA15] and an approach based on variational Bayes [BCKW15]. Our method performs better than both of these, is much simpler to implement, and uses less computation at test time.  
We study the matrix completion problem with side information. Side information has been considered in several matrix completion applications, and has been empirically shown to be useful in many cases. Recently, researchers studied the effect of side information for matrix completion from a theoretical viewpoint, showing that sample complexity can be significantly reduced given completely clean features. However, since in reality most given features are noisy or only weakly informative, the development of a model to handle a general feature set, and investigation of how much noisy features can help matrix recovery, remains an important issue. In this paper, we propose a novel model that balances between features and observations simultaneously in order to leverage feature information yet be robust to feature noise. Moreover, we study the effect of general features in theory and show that by using our model, the sample complexity can be lower than matrix completion as long as features are sufficiently informative. This result provides a theoretical insight into the usefulness of general side information. Finally, we consider synthetic data and two applications — relationship prediction and semisupervised clustering — and show that our model outperforms other methods for matrix completion that use features both in theory and practice.  
Many practical modeling problems involve discrete data that are best represented as draws from multinomial or categorical distributions. For example, nucleotides in a DNA sequence, children’s names in a given state and year, and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomial distributions. In all of these cases, we expect some form of dependency between the draws: the nucleotide at one position in the DNA strand may depend on the preceding nucleotides, children’s names are highly correlated from year to year, and topics in text may be correlated and dynamic. These dependencies are not naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation. Here, we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in Pólya-gamma augmentation to reformulate the multinomial distribution in terms of latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods, enabling us to take advantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models with minimal overhead.  
Our goal is to deploy a high-accuracy system starting with zero training examples. We consider an on-the-job setting, where as inputs arrive, we use real-time crowdsourcing to resolve uncertainty where needed and output our prediction when confident. As the model improves over time, the reliance on crowdsourcing queries decreases. We cast our setting as a stochastic game based on Bayesian decision theory, which allows us to balance latency, cost, and accuracy objectives in a principled way. Computing the optimal policy is intractable, so we develop an approximation based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. We tested our approach on three datasets—named-entity recognition, sentiment classification, and image classification. On the NER task we obtained more than an order of magnitude reduction in cost compared to full human annotation, while boosting performance relative to the expert provided labels. We also achieve a 8% F1 improvement over having a single human label the whole set, and a 28% F1 improvement over online learning. “Poor is the pupil who does not surpass his master.” – Leonardo da Vinci  
In user-facing applications, displaying calibrated confidence measures— probabilities that correspond to true frequency—can be as important as obtaining high accuracy. We are interested in calibration for structured prediction problems such as speech recognition, optical character recognition, and medical diagnosis. Structured prediction presents new challenges for calibration: the output space is large, and users may issue many types of probability queries (e.g., marginals) on the structured output. We extend the notion of calibration so as to handle various subtleties pertaining to the structured setting, and then provide a simple recalibration method that trains a binary classifier to predict probabilities of interest. We explore a range of features appropriate for structured recalibration, and demonstrate their efficacy on three real-world datasets.  
Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied to many recognition problems. Although it can approximate a complex many-to-one function well when a large amount of training data is provided, it is still challenging to model complex structured output representations that effectively perform probabilistic inference and make diverse predictions. In this work, we develop a deep conditional generative model for structured output prediction using Gaussian latent variables. The model is trained efficiently in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes, and allows for fast prediction using stochastic feed-forward inference. In addition, we provide novel strategies to build robust structured prediction algorithms, such as input noise-injection and multi-scale prediction objective at training. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in comparison to the deterministic deep neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic structured output predictions using stochastic inference. Furthermore, the proposed training methods are complimentary, which leads to strong pixel-level object segmentation and semantic labeling performance on Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 and the subset of Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset.  
By making personalized suggestions, a recommender system is playing a crucial role in improving the engagement of users in modern web-services. However, most recommendation algorithms do not explicitly take into account the temporal behavior and the recurrent activities of users. Two central but less explored questions are how to recommend the most desirable item at the right moment, and how to predict the next returning time of a user to a service. To address these questions, we propose a novel framework which connects self-exciting point processes and low-rank models to capture the recurrent temporal patterns in a large collection of user-item consumption pairs. We show that the parameters of the model can be estimated via a convex optimization, and furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm that maintains O(1/) convergence rate, scales up to problems with millions of user-item pairs and hundreds of millions of temporal events. Compared to other state-of-the-arts in both synthetic and real datasets, our model achieves superb predictive performance in the two time-sensitive recommendation tasks. Finally, we point out that our formulation can incorporate other extra context information of users, such as profile, textual and spatial features.  
We introduce the Gaussian Process Convolution Model (GPCM), a two-stage nonparametric generative procedure to model stationary signals as the convolution between a continuous-time white-noise process and a continuous-time linear filter drawn from Gaussian process. The GPCM is a continuous-time nonparametricwindow moving average process and, conditionally, is itself a Gaussian process with a nonparametric kernel defined in a probabilistic fashion. The generative model can be equivalently considered in the frequency domain, where the power spectral density of the signal is specified using a Gaussian process. One of the main contributions of the paper is to develop a novel variational freeenergy approach based on inter-domain inducing variables that efficiently learns the continuous-time linear filter and infers the driving white-noise process. In turn, this scheme provides closed-form probabilistic estimates of the covariance kernel and the noise-free signal both in denoising and prediction scenarios. Additionally, the variational inference procedure provides closed-form expressions for the approximate posterior of the spectral density given the observed data, leading to new Bayesian nonparametric approaches to spectrum estimation. The proposed GPCM is validated using synthetic and real-world signals.  
We propose a mechanism for purchasing information from a sequence of participants. The participants may simply hold data points they wish to sell, or may have more sophisticated information; either way, they are incentivized to participate as long as they believe their data points are representative or their information will improve the mechanism’s future prediction on a test set. The mechanism, which draws on the principles of prediction markets, has a bounded budget and minimizes generalization error for Bregman divergence loss functions. We then show how to modify this mechanism to preserve the privacy of participants’ information: At any given time, the current prices and predictions of the mechanism reveal almost no information about any one participant, yet in total over all participants, information is accurately aggregated.  
Lifted inference rules exploit symmetries for fast reasoning in statistical relational models. Computational complexity of these rules is highly dependent on the choice of the constraint language they operate on and therefore coming up with the right kind of representation is critical to the success of lifted inference. In this paper, we propose a new constraint language, called setineq, which allows subset, equality and inequality constraints, to represent substitutions over the variables in the theory. Our constraint formulation is strictly more expressive than existing representations, yet easy to operate on. We reformulate the three main lifting rules: decomposer, generalized binomial and the recently proposed single occurrence for MAP inference, to work with our constraint representation. Experiments on benchmark MLNs for exact and sampling based inference demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several other existing techniques.  
In a variety of problems originating in supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, the loss function is defined by an expectation over a collection of random variables, which might be part of a probabilistic model or the external world. Estimating the gradient of this loss function, using samples, lies at the core of gradient-based learning algorithms for these problems. We introduce the formalism of stochastic computation graphs—directed acyclic graphs that include both deterministic functions and conditional probability distributions—and describe how to easily and automatically derive an unbiased estimator of the loss function’s gradient. The resulting algorithm for computing the gradient estimator is a simple modification of the standard backpropagation algorithm. The generic scheme we propose unifies estimators derived in variety of prior work, along with variance-reduction techniques therein. It could assist researchers in developing intricate models involving a combination of stochastic and deterministic operations, enabling, for example, attention, memory, and control actions.  
Stochastic search algorithms are general black-box optimizers. Due to their ease of use and their generality, they have recently also gained a lot of attention in operations research, machine learning and policy search. Yet, these algorithms require a lot of evaluations of the objective, scale poorly with the problem dimension, are affected by highly noisy objective functions and may converge prematurely. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a new surrogate-based stochastic search approach. We learn simple, quadratic surrogate models of the objective function. As the quality of such a quadratic approximation is limited, we do not greedily exploit the learned models. The algorithm can be misled by an inaccurate optimum introduced by the surrogate. Instead, we use information theoretic constraints to bound the ‘distance’ between the new and old data distribution while maximizing the objective function. Additionally the new method is able to sustain the exploration of the search distribution to avoid premature convergence. We compare our method with state of art black-box optimization methods on standard uni-modal and multi-modal optimization functions, on simulated planar robot tasks and a complex robot ball throwing task. The proposed method considerably outperforms the existing approaches.  
We combine supervised learning with unsupervised learning in deep neural networks. The proposed model is trained to simultaneously minimize the sum of supervised and unsupervised cost functions by backpropagation, avoiding the need for layer-wise pre-training. Our work builds on top of the Ladder network proposed by Valpola [1] which we extend by combining the model with supervision. We show that the resulting model reaches state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised MNIST and CIFAR-10 classification in addition to permutationinvariant MNIST classification with all labels.  
A key bottleneck in structured output prediction is the need for inference during training and testing, usually requiring some form of dynamic programming. Rather than using approximate inference or tailoring a specialized inference method for a particular structure—standard responses to the scaling challenge— we propose to embed prediction constraints directly into the learned representation. By eliminating the need for explicit inference a more scalable approach to structured output prediction can be achieved, particularly at test time. We demonstrate the idea for multi-label prediction under subsumption and mutual exclusion constraints, where a relationship to maximum margin structured output prediction can be established. Experiments demonstrate that the benefits of structured output training can still be realized even after inference has been eliminated.  
We develop a general variational inference method that preserves dependency among the latent variables. Our method uses copulas to augment the families of distributions used in mean-field and structured approximations. Copulas model the dependency that is not captured by the original variational distribution, and thus the augmented variational family guarantees better approximations to the posterior. With stochastic optimization, inference on the augmented distribution is scalable. Furthermore, our strategy is generic: it can be applied to any inference procedure that currently uses the mean-field or structured approach. Copula variational inference has many advantages: it reduces bias; it is less sensitive to local optima; it is less sensitive to hyperparameters; and it helps characterize and interpret the dependency among the latent variables.  
Efforts to automate the reconstruction of neural circuits from 3D electron microscopic (EM) brain images are critical for the field of connectomics. An important computation for reconstruction is the detection of neuronal boundaries. Images acquired by serial section EM, a leading 3D EM technique, are highly anisotropic, with inferior quality along the third dimension. For such images, the 2D maxpooling convolutional network has set the standard for performance at boundary detection. Here we achieve a substantial gain in accuracy through three innovations. Following the trend towards deeper networks for object recognition, we use a much deeper network than previously employed for boundary detection. Second, we incorporate 3D as well as 2D filters, to enable computations that use 3D context. Finally, we adopt a recursively trained architecture in which a first network generates a preliminary boundary map that is provided as input along with the original image to a second network that generates a final boundary map. Backpropagation training is accelerated by ZNN, a new implementation of 3D convolutional networks that uses multicore CPU parallelism for speed. Our hybrid 2D3D architecture could be more generally applicable to other types of anisotropic 3D images, including video, and our recursive framework for any image labeling problem.  
In past few years, several techniques have been proposed for training of linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) in limited-memory setting, where a dual blockcoordinate descent (dual-BCD) method was used to balance cost spent on I/O and computation. In this paper, we consider the more general setting of regularized Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) when data cannot fit into memory. In particular, we generalize the existing block minimization framework based on strong duality and Augmented Lagrangian technique to achieve global convergence for general convex ERM. The block minimization framework is flexible in the sense that, given a solver working under sufficient memory, one can integrate it with the framework to obtain a solver globally convergent under limited-memory condition. We conduct experiments on L1-regularized classification and regression problems to corroborate our convergence theory and compare the proposed framework to algorithms adopted from online and distributed settings, which shows superiority of the proposed approach on data of size ten times larger than the memory capacity.  
Given samples from an unknown discrete distribution p, is it possible to distinguish whether p belongs to some class of distributions C versus p being far from every distribution in C? This fundamental question has received tremendous attention in statistics, focusing primarily on asymptotic analysis, as well as in information theory and theoretical computer science, where the emphasis has been on small sample size and computational complexity. Nevertheless, even for basic properties of discrete distributions such as monotonicity, independence, logconcavity, unimodality, and monotone-hazard rate, the optimal sample complexity is unknown. We provide a general approach via which we obtain sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for all these distribution families. At the core of our approach is an algorithm which solves the following problem: Given samples from an unknown distribution p, and a known distribution q, are p and q close in 2-distance, or far in total variation distance? The optimality of our testers is established by providing matching lower bounds, up to constant factors. Finally, a necessary building block for our testers and an important byproduct of our work are the first known computationally efficient proper learners for discrete log-concave, monotone hazard rate distributions.  
The Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Model (CT-HMM) is an attractive approach to modeling disease progression due to its ability to describe noisy observations arriving irregularly in time. However, the lack of an efficient parameter learning algorithm for CT-HMM restricts its use to very small models or requires unrealistic constraints on the state transitions. In this paper, we present the first complete characterization of efficient EM-based learning methods for CT-HMM models. We demonstrate that the learning problem consists of two challenges: the estimation of posterior state probabilities and the computation of end-state conditioned statistics. We solve the first challenge by reformulating the estimation problem in terms of an equivalent discrete time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov model. The second challenge is addressed by adapting three approaches from the continuous time Markov chain literature to the CT-HMM domain. We demonstrate the use of CT-HMMs with more than 100 states to visualize and predict disease progression using a glaucoma dataset and an Alzheimer’s disease dataset.  
We propose an original particle-based implementation of the Loopy Belief Propagation (LPB) algorithm for pairwise Markov Random Fields (MRF) on a continuous state space. The algorithm constructs adaptively efficient proposal distributions approximating the local beliefs at each note of the MRF. This is achieved by considering proposal distributions in the exponential family whose parameters are updated iterately in an Expectation Propagation (EP) framework. The proposed particle scheme provides consistent estimation of the LBP marginals as the number of particles increases. We demonstrate that it provides more accurate results than the Particle Belief Propagation (PBP) algorithm of [1] at a fraction of the computational cost and is additionally more robust empirically. The computational complexity of our algorithm at each iteration is quadratic in the number of particles. We also propose an accelerated implementation with sub-quadratic computational complexity which still provides consistent estimates of the loopy BP marginal distributions and performs almost as well as the original procedure.  
In many statistical problems, a more coarse-grained model may be suitable for population-level behaviour, whereas a more detailed model is appropriate for accurate modelling of individual behaviour. This raises the question of how to integrate both types of models. Methods such as posterior regularization follow the idea of generalized moment matching, in that they allow matching expectations between two models, but sometimes both models are most conveniently expressed as latent variable models. We propose latent Bayesian melding, which is motivated by averaging the distributions over populations statistics of both the individual-level and the population-level models under a logarithmic opinion pool framework. In a case study on electricity disaggregation, which is a type of singlechannel blind source separation problem, we show that latent Bayesian melding leads to significantly more accurate predictions than an approach based solely on generalized moment matching.  
This paper proposes a distributionally robust approach to logistic regression. We use the Wasserstein distance to construct a ball in the space of probability distributions centered at the uniform distribution on the training samples. If the radius of this ball is chosen judiciously, we can guarantee that it contains the unknown datagenerating distribution with high confidence. We then formulate a distributionally robust logistic regression model that minimizes a worst-case expected logloss function, where the worst case is taken over all distributions in the Wasserstein ball. We prove that this optimization problem admits a tractable reformulation and encapsulates the classical as well as the popular regularized logistic regression problems as special cases. We further propose a distributionally robust approach based on Wasserstein balls to compute upper and lower confidence bounds on the misclassification probability of the resulting classifier. These bounds are given by the optimal values of two highly tractable linear programs. We validate our theoretical out-of-sample guarantees through simulated and empirical experiments.  
We investigate a local reparameterizaton technique for greatly reducing the variance of stochastic gradients for variational Bayesian inference (SGVB) of a posterior over model parameters, while retaining parallelizability. This local reparameterization translates uncertainty about global parameters into local noise that is independent across datapoints in the minibatch. Such parameterizations can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is inversely proportional to the minibatch size, generally leading to much faster convergence. Additionally, we explore a connection with dropout: Gaussian dropout objectives correspond to SGVB with local reparameterization, a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance. Our method allows inference of more flexibly parameterized posteriors; specifically, we propose variational dropout, a generalization of Gaussian dropout where the dropout rates are learned, often leading to better models. The method is demonstrated through several experiments.
